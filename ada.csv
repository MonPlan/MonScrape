Wunderkammers) and present-day instances of curating where the term has become virtually synonymous with any act of selection (music, photographs, food). The overall aim of the unit is provide students with a working vocabulary so that they can ask critical questions of the contemporary practice of curation.Lectures will largely provide a chronological history of curation, starting with early museums and collections, but with an emphasis on the rise of curating and the figure of the curator from the mid-1970s on. A number of key instances of curation (particular exhibitions and international Biennales and Triennials) will be selected for particular analysis. In this way, students will be given both an overall history of art curation and a way of thinking the term's almost infinite expansion in the present.

Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final ""public"" (whether in reality or using such technologies as the internet) exhibition of such curation and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. Students will work with their lecturer throughout the semester to develop this exhibition/series of exhibitions. Classes will consist of 3-hour long seminars in which the lecturer works with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold ""crit"" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped. As in art-making classes, an end-of-class overall exhibition will be planned, and part of the unit will require students (along with the lecturer) to plan how such an overall exhibition of exhibitions might be conceived, planned and brought to practical realisation.

Students will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. Students will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and themselves undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. Students will especially be directed to thinking what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for themselves and others to put the art-historical knowledge they otherwise gain in their studies to practical use in the public arena?Throughout the unit a number of practical exercises in writing about art will be undertaken, giving students a sense of the different requirements for different kinds of writing. Above all, they will form the habit of writing about art, and understand that writing about art is a ""practice"" just as artists have a practice. To this extent, Art Writing and Criticism must be seen as allied to the new units offered in art curation (Curating: Histories and Theories and Curating: Practices) in opening up to students studying Art History certain ""practical"" or ""vocational"" outcomes for their skills and knowledges."

Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final ""public"" (whether in reality or using such technologies as the internet) exhibition of such curation and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. Students will work with their lecturer throughout the semester to develop this exhibition/series of exhibitions. Classes will consist of 3-hour long seminars in which the lecturer works with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold ""crit"" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped.

A high degree of independence, combined with advanced conceptual lucidity and prowess in the development of curatorial, collective and individual practices should be evident at this stage. Students develop final individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their personal direction and evolving practice, that provide a bridge to the broader arts industry."
VPR3011,Professional practice advanced,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture","[[['Caulfield'], ['First semester 2017 (Day)']]]",6,0.125,VPR2012 and 1 department approved elective,VPR3001,1,"This is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence and is first of the two 3rd year units. The unit provides students with an advanced perspective on the various modes of publication available to cultural practitioners engaged in Visual Art. This unit gives students an opportunity to incorporate theoretical frameworks that reflect and expand upon a breadth of fields that include education, business, information technology or the liberal arts into their production of visual culture. This unit asks students to develop self-directed strategies that extend upon traditional gallery based exhibition modes. These modes might include: artists' books, editioned objects; site-based research and exhibiting; digital broadcast; collaborative, social and/or performative processes; curatorial contexts; and creative arts writing. The workshop program encourages an experimental and critical approach to conceptual and material outcomes whilst providing opportunities to cultivate curatorial, critical writing and administrative skills. Students are required to initiate individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer-review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit."
VPR3012,Visual practices 3,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture","[[['Caulfield'], ['Second semester 2017 (Day)']]]",12,0.250,VPR3011 and 2 department approved electives,VPR3002,1,"This unit is the last and culminating unit in the Visual Practices sequence and is second of the two 3rd year units. In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level."
VSA4012,Visual culture and its theories,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",[],12,0.250,,VSA 3010,1,"This unit is designed to equip honours students with critical and theoretical skills appropriate to the study of art history and visual culture at an advanced level. Topics to be considered will include theories of the image, representation and meaning, the operation of ideology, especially in relation to race and gender, social theories (including Marxist and neo-Marxist accounts), applications of psychoanalysis to the visual field, postmodernism and its critiques, cyberculture, and recent theorisations of visual culture."
VSA4022,Beyond the museum,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",[],12,0.250,,,1,"The unit will consider the ways in which contemporary artists and theorists have attempted to reform the structure of the art institution. Alternative art practices and spaces in Australia will be considered with reference to events in Europe and America. Marxist and feminist initiatives will be analysed in detail. The concept of the 'global village,' will be examined and the successes and failures of the different initiatives will be studied in relation to contemporary theories and arts policy in Australia."
VSA4025,Visual culture internship,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",[],12,0.250,,,1,"This unit is based on a practice of internships for students in cultural institutions. It is designed to provide students with first hand experience of working within the culture industry while introducing them to the types of research customarily undertaken in such institutions. After several preliminary seminars, students will be assigned to a museum/ gallery in which they will work for two days per week, over a period of nine weeks, under the direction of the relevant director. They will undertake a research project of specific relevance to the cultural institution."
VSA4076,Australian postmodernism,"Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",[],12,0.250,,,1,"The recurring issues of regionalism and internationalism will be addressed, as will interpretations of Australia as the site of international congruence and influence. The unit will move from discussion of the American influence of The Field exhibition of 1968 to the 'pluralism' of the 1970s: minimal art, performance art and feminism. The focus on the 1980s and 1990s will address some of the following: neo-expressionism, appropriation, nomadology, aboriginality, theoretical issues and the current status of Australian art, including recent developments in abstraction, installation, gay art and 'angry women.'"
