You will engage with contemporary ideas and practices and learn how to foster the learning of children and young people with varied needs. This will enable you to develop your students' creative, intellectual, physical, personal and social capabilities.</p><p >While learning to handle the complex nature of teaching, you will develop the specific professional knowledge and teaching skills needed to engage students of various ages and developmental stages with particular school subjects. Depending upon your specialisation, you will develop the skills and knowledge needed to teach in learning areas such as the arts and music, English, mathematics, civics and citizenship, physical education, health and wellbeing, science and humanities. Professional experience placements offered throughout the course in urban, rural, remote or international locations and educational settings will build your knowledge of teaching and learning. As a result, you will become a thoughtful, effective and inclusive educator, able to design learning experiences that ensure your future students have the right balance of challenge and support.</p><p >The Bachelor of Education (Honours) prepares professional educators for the global workforce.

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Structure</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The course develops through the four themes of Part A. Education studies, Part B. Curriculum studies, Part C. Discipline studies and Part D. Professional studies. The nature and proportion of units required among these themes will differ depending upon your specialisation.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part A. Education studies </h3>
<p >These studies provide the theoretical foundations of education that underpin the teaching and learning of children and young people in varied education settings. You will study contemporary theories of child or adolescent development, focusing on the age range relevant to your specialisation. You will also study sociology, psychology, diversity and inclusion, the broad principles of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, and develop an understanding of the relationship between education and society at local, national and global levels. These studies emphasise educational inquiry and will ensure that your teaching is informed by current research and practice. You will acquire the foundation to move into leadership roles as your career progresses.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part B. Curriculum studies </h3>
<p >These studies develop the knowledge and skills you will need to become a skilled and effective educator who is able to draw on an ever-growing and flexible repertoire of strategies to suit particular children, educational contexts and learning outcomes. You will learn how to design, plan and implement engaging, innovative and productive learning experiences in order to meet diverse learners' needs. You will also develop your own knowledge and skills in key learning areas relevant to the educational level of your specialisation, deepening your understanding of teaching and learning strategies, theories and practices related to the subjects you will be teaching.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part C. Discipline studies </h3>
<p >These studies will develop your content knowledge in the subjects you will be teaching in schools or other education settings. Through a focused sequence of study, you will deepen and advance your knowledge in your teaching specialist areas or in foundational disciplines such as English and literacy or mathematics and numeracy. In the double degree course, your discipline studies are taken within the partner degree course. The disciplines available depend upon your specialisation. For more details refer to the links under 'Specialisations' below.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part D. Professional studies </h3>
<p >These studies will provide you with an understanding of professional identity and leadership as well as professional experience through the completion of supervised placement in settings relevant to your teaching specialisation. Professional experience connects the theoretical components of the other themes with practical aspects of teaching and learning. The number of days of professional experience required for professional registration will depend upon your specialisation. You will also undertake research units to develop your understanding of research principles and methods and the skills and capacities to design and conduct research with some independence.</p></div>
