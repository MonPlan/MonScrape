<div class="pub_body">
<h2 class="black pub_heading">Description</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The Bachelor of Health Sciences will provide you with a sound foundation in health science and a broad overview of health care, and with skills in identifying, investigating, analysing and assessing health issues. This foundation leads to a number of specialisations enabling you to pursue a variety of allied and public health career paths. The course is suited to those who wish to undertake clinical work or research either immediately or after pursuing a post graduate degree, and those who wish to progress to the non-clinical health workforce including epidemiology, health promotion, planning or policy. The common thread is the commitment to an evidence based approach to delivering quality health care efficiently and effectively whether the focus is on individuals, families or communities.</p><p >Your studies commence at the Caulfield campus, where you will apply scientific approaches to the study and improvement of health, considering physiological, behavioural, developmental, social and environmental aspects of human health and disease.  At the conclusion of the first semester of second year, you will continue with a chosen specialisation at its campus base of Peninsula, Caulfield or Clayton, developing an in-depth knowledge of the theory and practice of one of the following fields of health science:</p><ul><li> Emergency health and paramedic practice</li><li> Human services</li><li> Public health science</li><li> Radiation sciences.</li></ul>
<h2 class="black">Specialisations</h2>
<h3 class="blue">Emergency health and paramedic practice</h3>
<p >The emergency health and paramedic practice specialisation will prepare you for employment as paramedics in ambulance and community-based emergency health services (CBEH). Paramedics provide unscheduled health care for individuals experiencing a health emergency in the community, and initiate care and determine appropriate referral of patients to enable continuing care. Paramedics are also required to work with other emergency services to respond to a range of situations including mass casualty incidents.</p><h3 class="blue">Human services </h3>
<p >The human services specialisation focuses on implementing and promoting child and family wellbeing programs and working with communities to build capacities. In particular, it looks towards improving the lives of people who are disadvantaged. The course covers cultural, psychological and environmental issues affecting human mental and physical health and the provision of human services. Students also undertake studies in human service practice relating to individuals, families, groups and communities.</p><p >There is an emphasis on current practice and participation in supervised professional practice which adds to the relevance of this degree. It also includes studies related to social work and human services research, social policy and management.</p><h3 class="blue">Public health science</h3>
<p >The public health science specialisation focuses on populations and communities rather than individuals, and spans the spectrum from promoting good health, through preventing disease, to managing illness and disability. The course includes aspects of biomedical sciences (such as physiology and pharmacology) and social sciences (such as sociology and program evaluation) along with epidemiology, biostatistics and research methods. It focuses on developing, implementing and evaluating programs and policies to promote health and prevent disease and injury, and undertaking public health research. The course has a global orientation, examining both Australian and international health challenges.</p><h3 class="blue">Radiation sciences</h3>
<p >This specialisation combines scientific and technical knowledge with studies in health and patient care.</p><p >Radiation therapy uses ionising radiations for the treatment of cancer and benign conditions.</p><p >Topics covered include radiation physics and instrumentation, radiobiology, imaging anatomy, physiology, epidemiology, oncology, radiation therapy, cancer management strategies and patient care.  Beginner-level clinical skills are developed in the following areas: computerised tomography; radiation therapy planning; radiation therapy treatment; and patient care and management. Psychology, medico-legal and ethical aspects of health care, cultural and communicative competence, and occupational health and safety are also considered.</p></div>

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Outcomes</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >These course outcomes are aligned with the <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html">Australian Qualifications Framework level 7 and Monash Graduate Attributes</a><span class="pub_print_url">Australian Qualifications Framework level 7 and Monash Graduate Attributes (<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html" >http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html</a>)</span>.</p><p >Upon successful completion of this course it is expected that graduates will be able to:</p><ol start="1"><li> apply knowledge of human health, disease and promotion to a range of professional contexts</li><li> demonstrate in-depth knowledge of a specific health science discipline</li><li> develop, apply, integrate and generate health science knowledge in professional contexts to analyse challenges and to develop effective solutions</li><li> collect, organise, analyse, interpret and report health data</li><li> communicate effectively with diverse audiences and in a variety of formats</li><li> work and learn in both independent and collaborative ways with others to encompass diverse abilities and perspectives</li><li> exercise personal, professional and social responsibility as a global citizen.</li></ol></div>

<div class="pub_body_text">
<h2 class="black">Special requirements</h2>
<h3 class="blue">Police checks</h3>
<p >Students must have a current police check regarding their suitability to undertake placements. Refer to the faculty's <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/police-checks.html">Police check</a><span class="pub_print_url">Police check (<a href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/police-checks.html" >http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/police-checks.html</a>)</span> webpage.</p><p >Note: Students studying the public health specialisation do not require a police check.</p><h3 class="blue">Working with Children checks</h3>
<p >Students must have a current Working with Children check regarding their suitability to undertake placements. Refer to the faculty's <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/wwc-check.html">Working with Children Checks</a><span class="pub_print_url">Working with Children Checks (<a href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/wwc-check.html" >http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/wwc-check.html</a>)</span> webpage.</p><p >Note: Students studying the public health specialisation do not require a Working with Childrens check.</p><h3 class="blue">Immunisation and infection requirements</h3>
<p >In accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council recommendations, this course requires that students comply with the faculty's <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/immunisation/">Immunisation and vaccination policy and procedures</a><span class="pub_print_url">Immunisation and vaccination policy and procedures (<a href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/immunisation/" >http://www.med.monash.edu.au/current/immunisation/</a>)</span>. These are designed to provide maximum protection against the increased risk of some vaccine preventable diseases for students, patients and workers in a health care setting.</p><p >This policy, and the associated procedures require that students have certain specified vaccinations, and have their blood borne virus status determined, before they commence a clinical placement. Students who have not complied with this policy may not be able to undertake clinical placement, with the attendant academic consequences.</p><h3 class="blue">Health check (Emergency health and paramedic practice students only)</h3>
<p >The health and fitness assessment process involves a review of medical history and physical fitness. You need to carefully consider your full medical history and ask questions early. A medical issue that you may otherwise assume is not an issue, may prevent you meeting the medical history test. Similarly the fitness test involves a thorough physical examination and includes a fitness test that may require you to undertake fitness preparation. Details of the physical assessment can be found on the <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://med.monash.edu.au/cehpp/ugrad/clinical-placement-information.html">Clinical placement information</a><span class="pub_print_url">Clinical placement information (<a href="http://med.monash.edu.au/cehpp/ugrad/clinical-placement-information.html" >http://med.monash.edu.au/cehpp/ugrad/clinical-placement-information.html</a>)</span> website.</p><p >If you have any questions or concerns about your medical history or physical health and fitness, you must call Ambulance Victoria Medical Services Provider on telephone 1800 240 395 to obtain information and advice prior to enrolling in the emergency health and paramedic practice specialisation. Monash does not accept responsibility for students who enrol but cannot complete the course due to an inability to meet the medical and fitness tests imposed by Ambulance Victoria.</p></div>

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Structure</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The course develops through four themes of: personal and professional development; population, communities, health and illness; the scientific basis of health care; and applied practice.</p><h3 class="blue">Part A. Personal and professional development </h3>
<p >These studies will develop your understanding of the roles, responsibilities and expectations of health professionals and the personal and professional attributes you will need in the workplace. These include communication and interpersonal skills, teamwork, critical thinking, ethical and legal issues, and reflective practice. You will also learn about research methodologies and the application of research to the field of health.</p><h3 class="blue">Part B. Population, communities, health and illness  </h3>
<p >The focus of these studies is the social, environmental and behavioural contexts of ill health, disease and injury and broad societal issues such as health promotion, the application of epidemiology and statistics in the assessment of health risk in populations, public health, community diversity, population and global health. You will also develop a sound understanding of evidence-based practice.</p><h3 class="blue">Part C. Scientific basis of health care practice</h3>
<p >These studies provide the foundation scientific knowledge of human systems and technology that you will require to become an expert in your area of health science. Depending upon your specialisation this will range over physical, biomedical, mathematical and behavioural sciences.</p><h3 class="blue">Part D. Professional practice skills</h3>
<p >This theme addresses competencies for health science practice within your area of specialisation. The specific skills may relate to basic and advanced life support, building child and family well-being and capacities, programs to promote health and prevent disease, or radiation science. Whatever your specialist context, the focus will be on the incorporation of the best available research evidence with the clinical reasoning skills of assessment, management, evaluation and health care across the lifespan and across a spectrum of environments and circumstances.</p><h3 class="blue">Part E. Free elective study </h3>
<p >Where available, elective study will enable you to further develop your knowledge of health science or to select units from across the University in which you are eligible to enrol.</p></div>
