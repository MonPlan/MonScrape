<h2 class="black pub_heading">Structure</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The course develops through four themes that combine to underpin engineering practice: fundamentals and foundational skills, design, knowledge and applications, and professional practice.</p><h3 class="blue">Part A. Engineering fundamentals and foundational skills</h3>
<p >These will develop your understanding of natural and physical sciences, mathematics, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer and information sciences that underpin all engineering disciplines.</p><h3 class="blue">Part B. Engineering design </h3>
<p >This will develop the engineering techniques, tools and resources for the conduct, design and management of engineering design processes and projects, both in the industrial setting and in the development of research experiments.</p><h3 class="blue">Part C. Engineering knowledge and application </h3>
<p >This will provide in-depth knowledge of the specific engineering methods of a branch of engineering, and will integrate the specific engineering methods and discipline knowledge into practice. You will develop skills to identify and apply knowledge of contextual factors impacting the engineering discipline. Additionally, your studies will focus on your understanding and application of the scope, principles, norms, accountabilities and bounds of contemporary engineering practice in your discipline.</p><h3 class="blue">Part D. Professional practice </h3>
<p >This will develop your skills in readiness for the engineering workplace. You will develop skills in effective team membership and team leadership, the use and management of commercially relevant data, and the legal responsibilities of engineers. This study will integrate the theme 'Engineering knowledge and application' with your specialist field of engineering.</p><h3 class="blue">Part E. Elective study </h3>
<p >This will enable you to further deepen your knowledge of engineering or broaden your knowledge in another approved field. Students completing a single degree course may use electives to add technical expertise in their engineering specialisation and/or to complete one of the <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/undergrad/eng-beng-approved-minors.html">engineering-approved minors</a><span class="pub_print_url">engineering-approved minors (<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/undergrad/eng-beng-approved-minors.html" >http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/undergrad/eng-beng-approved-minors.html</a>)</span> from another faculty thereby adding other skills to their repertoire. If you wish to take more than two units outside the faculty, and you are not using the additional units to complete one of the approved minors, you must consult with and gain permission from your course advisor before doing so.</p><p >In order to meet local accreditation requirements, students studying their degree on the Malaysia campus must choose technical engineering units to fulfil the elective requirements of their engineering degree.</p><p >Students in the master's accelerated pathway will select a mix of electives from engineering, or from across the University in which you are eligible to enrol, in conjunction with 12 credit points taken from <a href="../courses/E6001.html">E6001</a> Master of Advanced Engineering.</p></div>
