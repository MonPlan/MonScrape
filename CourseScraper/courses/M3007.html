<h2 class="black pub_heading">Description</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The Bachelor of Nursing and Bachelor of Midwifery (Honours) course aims to produce dynamic graduate nurses and midwives who will be leaders in healthcare in the 21st century. The course prepares nurses and midwives with the requisite knowledge and skills to be effective and perceptive communicators, graduating from the course with the capabilities and attributes to have a positive impact on the future of the nursing and midwifery professions and the quality of peoples' lives. As a graduate you will be recognised for your excellent and innovative practice and leadership as you identify and effect change in health care. This care will reflect contemporary nursing and midwifery knowledge and practice, clinical reasoning skill, research literacy and technology.</p><p >Midwives play a crucial role in maternity care provision working in partnership with women during pregnancy, birth and in the postnatal period. This course produces a registered nurse and a registered midwife, a highly capable individual able to work with the interdisciplinary team in nursing and midwifery practice settings. The versatility of the nurse and midwife has become increasingly important in Australian and international health services and the two qualifications will make you highly employable in any practice setting, especially in rural and remote areas where being multi-skilled can save lives.</p><p >Monash nursing and midwifery graduates are sought after worldwide because of our teaching quality, which ensures that our graduates possess valuable skills in clinical reasoning, client care, communication, clinical judgement and research literacy developed through extensive clinical experience in a variety of local and international health agencies. These are underpinned and strengthened by our links to world-class medical researchers and major teaching hospitals.</p><p >The course will prepare you for increasingly complex health care situations in Australia and internationally. As a nursing graduate you will have acquired the knowledge and skills to be a competent beginning-level registered nurse who can provide leadership and care across the age continuum, and you will have the scope to provide care in multiple settings, including acute care, primary health care and health promotion. You will develop knowledge for the safe practice of clinical skills in a variety of health care facilities and services over the course of your studies, and develop a broad range of knowledge in relevant disciplines, enabling you to critically analyse health care situations, concepts and perspectives.</p><p >As a midwifery graduate you will add to the above capabilities the specialist knowledge to provide continuous care to mothers and babies from pregnancy to after birth in any situation, including obstetric emergencies.</p><p >You will have plenty of opportunity for clinical experience in diverse settings throughout Victoria and you may also get the opportunity to study and undertake clinical placements in Sweden or the UK under our successful student exchange programs. Your clinical and professional skills will be further developed through time spent working with students enrolled in other health science courses (i.e. medical imaging, nutrition and dietetics, occupational therapy, paramedic, physiotherapy, social work) enabling you to experience interdisciplinary service delivery and inter-professional education.</p><p >Successful completion of the course will lead to eligibility for registration as a registered nurse and a registered midwife with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. The nursing degree creates local, national and international opportunities in a range of health service areas, such as acute hospital care, mental health, rehabilitation, aged care, community-based care and rural and remote services. The midwifery degree creates opportunities in midwifery, including in antenatal, birth and postnatal areas. You could also specialise in neonatal, maternal, child health care or other fields with further study.</p></div>

<div class="pub_body_text">
<p>Successful completion of the course will lead to eligibility for registration as a registered nurse and a registered midwife, each with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia.</p></div>

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Structure</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The Bachelor of Midwifery (Honours) course builds on the fundamental skills and knowledge required for nursing and on the clinical nursing practice developed through the Bachelor of Nursing, adding the specialist knowledge to provide continuous care to mothers and babies from pregnancy through to after birth in any situation, including emergencies and the knowledge and skills to locate, interpret and critically evaluate research relevant to advanced practice in midwifery.</p><p >The course develops through themes addressing your personal and professional development; understanding of society, population, health and illness; translation of knowledge for clinical nursing and midwifery practice; clinical nursing skills; and advanced clinical midwifery practice.</p><h3 class="blue">Part A. Personal and professional development</h3>
<p >These studies focus on your development as a professional who is able to function and communicate both as a member of a health care team and autonomously as required. You will learn to become resilient, with a sense of self and of self-efficacy, to manage stress and your own health, identify professionally with both nursing and midwifery culture, and develop skill in client interactions and reflective practice. You will also develop your capacity to work within the healthcare environment, understand relevant issues of law and ethics, professional standards and accountability, inter-professional education and teamwork, leadership skills and autonomous practice, effective and perceptive communication, including therapeutic communication, and advocacy for the clients and carers.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part B. Society, population, health and illness </h3>
<p >These studies focus on the social, environmental and behavioural contexts and determinants of health and illness and the significance of these contexts on both the practice of nursing and midwifery. You will consider public, population and global health, health promotion and applied community health education, learn about community diversity and vulnerable populations and develop the essential cultural competence for nursing and midwifery. You will also develop the approaches to knowledge and information management needed for evidence-based practice and the knowledge and skills to locate, interpret and critically evaluate research relevant to advanced practice in midwifery.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part C. Translation of knowledge for clinical practice</h3>
<p >These studies provide the foundations of evidence-based healthcare as a highly skilled nurse. You will learn about the biological basis of human health through study of the biosciences (anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology of disease and microbiology) and pharmacology (including psychotropic medications). You will develop the capacity to apply this and other knowledge in healthcare interventions, including mental health, to critically evaluate evidence in relation to health and healthcare management and to make informed clinical decisions.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part D. Clinical nursing skills</h3>
<p >Through these studies you will acquire the clinical skills needed for the care of individuals including the assessment of clients' health status in order to determine and deliver competent nursing care. This will involve the integration of knowledge, patient assessment, practical procedures, patient handling, communication, clinical reasoning, interpersonal skills and management skills. You will cover medical and surgical nursing, including pharmacology, pain management, wound assessment and acute care, mental health care and care across the age span. Your skills will be developed in a range of contexts including health care facilities, community environments and simulated laboratory settings.</p><h3 class="blue"> Part E. Advanced midwifery theory and practice</h3>
<p >The focus of these studies is the effective care for women and their babies from preconception through to early parenting. You will develop the midwifery knowledge and skills required to work with women throughout labour and birth. Assessment of labour progress, common interventions and pain management are addressed, as the complexities of childbearing and emergency birthing challenges. You will learn about the assessment and care of the newborn infant both healthy and ill, and how to initiate emergency management of the newborn infant.</p></div>
