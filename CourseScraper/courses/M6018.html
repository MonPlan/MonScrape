<h2 class="black pub_heading">Description</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >Monash is the only Victorian university to offer both direct-from-school entry and graduate entry to the same medical degree. Whichever your pathway to medicine at Monash, you will see the discoveries of our world-renowned researchers put into clinical practice and enjoy our links to the largest health-care provider network in Australia, which includes the Monash Medical Centre and The Alfred, Melbourne's major casualty hospital, Eastern Health and health services in rural, regional and outer metropolitan Melbourne.</p><p >The course is designed as an integrated curriculum, with units taught in an interdisciplinary fashion by staff from across the faculty and in a wide range of learning environments, both campus and clinical.</p><p >Students entering as graduates are given one year of credit, and the integrated medical and behavioural sciences of the first two years of the course are replaced by one year of accelerated study (Year A) at the Monash University School of Rural Health located on the Gippsland campus of Federation University Australia. Year A is largely campus-based, with rural clinical and community placements. The Churchill (Gippsland) facilities include a sophisticated clinical simulations centre and access to state of the art clinical training facilities at the Latrobe regional hospital, Warragul, Sale, Wonthaggi and Leongatha hospitals and GP learning centres across West, Central, South and East Gippsland. At the completion of this one year of study graduate-entry students join the school-leaver cohort in Year 3B.</p><p >Years 3B to 5D of the course are conducted in clinical settings, generally in hospitals and practices across metropolitan Melbourne and rural Victoria. During this period students will spend around 40 hours per week working at a clinical site. This will provides students with time for self-directed study, and the time and opportunity to be in control of their own learning and to develop skills in problem-solving and the critical appraisal of information. Year 5D offers rotations through a number of clinical settings, such as aged care and emergency medicine, with the opportunity to undertake a scholarly intensive project.</p><p >The graduate entry program is open only to applicants who have completed a Monash University degree in biomedical science (including those undertaking double degrees), pharmacy, physiotherapy and science (with the completion of specific units) or have completed or are in the final year of a bachelor's degree with a significant biomedical science content at an internationally recognised university. Information about admission requirements can be found online.</p><p >The course is accredited by the Australian Medical Council. After successfully completing the course, graduates become eligible for provisional registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and the Medical Board of Australia. After serving a compulsory internship year of residence in an approved hospital, graduates become eligible for final registration in Victoria and other states of Australia. Graduates initially work as a doctor within the hospital system and can undertake further specialty training in a range of areas, such as general practice, obstetrics, paediatrics, psychiatry and surgery.</p><p >To broaden your options, you will have the opportunity to take intermission from your medicine studies after Year 3B to undertake the honours year of the Bachelor of Medical Science (leading to the award of Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours)), and focus on an area of medical science research, before returning to the course. This will place you in an excellent position to continue with medical research at a later stage, perhaps through a PhD, should you so wish.</p><h2 class="black">Rural practice</h2>
<p >All students are encouraged to spend time in rural areas. In order for the University to meet the requirements of the Australian Government Rural Clinical Training and Support (RCTS) program, all students that hold a Commonwealth-supported place (CSP) are required to undertake a minimum of four weeks experience in rural areas. A cohort of students will be given the opportunity to spend up to two years in a rural site.</p></div>

Attendance is mandatory for the clinical component of each unit. Students must be aware of the faculty's <a class="pub_screen_url" href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/policies/clinical-fieldwork-placement/index.html">Clinical/Fieldwork Placement Handbook - Guiding Principles, Procedures, Policies and Behavioural Requirements</a><span class="pub_print_url">Clinical/Fieldwork Placement Handbook - Guiding Principles, Procedures, Policies and Behavioural Requirements (<a href="http://www.med.monash.edu.au/policies/clinical-fieldwork-placement/index.html" >http://www.med.monash.edu.au/policies/clinical-fieldwork-placement/index.html</a>)</span>. Students will not be permitted to attend any clinical placements unless they have current valid Working with Children and Police checks, and have a satisfactory immunisation status.</p><h3 class="blue">Clinical expenses</h3>
<p >Students are responsible for all travel and accommodation expenses during clinical placements.</p></div>

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Professional recognition</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p>The course accreditation is provided by the Australian Medical Council (AMC) and the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC). The school-leaver entry Australian course is accredited by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC).</p></div>

<h2 class="black pub_heading">Structure</h2>
<div class="pub_body_text">
<p >The course develops through theme studies in personal and professional development; population, society, health and Illness; scientific basis of clinical practice; and clinical skills, all of which come together in professional practice demonstrated in the clinical placement units.</p><h3 class="blue">A. Theme 1: Personal and professional development</h3>
<p >'Personal and professional development' will focus on the doctor as an individual and concentrates on the personal attributes and qualities needed by medical students and, ultimately, medical practitioners. It covers elements of health enhancement, professional responsibilities, communication skills, information technology, medical informatics and computing skills, ethics and legal issues, and clinical effectiveness.</p><h3 class="blue">B. Theme 2: Population, society, health and illness</h3>
<p >'Population, society, health and illness' develops students' abilities to deal with broader society and population issues. Students will consider the social, environmental and behavioural contexts of illness and the practice of medicine, including an emphasis on rural and remote Australia. Other elements of this theme will be built around health promotion, epidemiology, public health, community diversity, population and global health, and a range of other societal issues. The history and philosophy of the scientific approach to medicine will also be included, extending this to approaches to knowledge and information, and an understanding of evidence-based medicine.</p><h3 class="blue">C. Theme 3: Scientific basis of clinical practice </h3>
<p >'Scientific basis of clinical practice' includes much of the human systems-based teaching in the course. The knowledge and concepts that underpin medicine, both in the basic medical sciences and in the clinical sciences, are included.</p><h3 class="blue">D. Theme 4: Clinical skills</h3>
<p >'Clinical skills' encompasses the whole range of clinical skills. This begins with clinical aspects of communication skills and introduction to practical clinical skills including handwashing, sharps disposal; subcutaneous and intramuscular injecting. Early in the course students will interact with health care professionals during medical contact visits, and will be introduced to the medical interview, taking a family history, ethical aspects of medical contact visits. Comprehensive history taking, systems based physical examinations and procedural clinical skills are further developed during later clinical placements. The approach in clinical skills development will be to develop defined clinical competencies.</p><p >Units are interdisciplinary, with themes woven through each semester.</p><h4 class="black">Year A</h4>
<p >Blocks of systems-based sub-units are presented with a mix of basic medical science content, patient-based presentations and discussions in small groups. These sub-units combine basic content with generic skills and are set in appropriate clinical contexts, largely through the use of patient-oriented learning. Topics include:</p><ul><li> cardiovascular system</li><li> endocrinology</li><li> gastrointestinal system</li><li> genomics</li><li> human behaviour</li><li> human development and growth</li><li> immunology and infection</li><li> metabolism</li><li> molecules, cells and tissues</li><li> musculo-skeletal system</li><li> neurosciences</li><li> nutrition</li><li> reproduction</li><li> respiratory system</li><li> urinary system.</li></ul>
<h4 class="black">Years 3B and 4C</h4>
<p >During this period, clinical content is delivered in blocks of clinical rotations, with a mix of advanced and applied medical science, patient-oriented presentations, and discussions in small tutorial groups. A variety of clinical settings are used, including a range of metropolitan and rural hospitals, ambulatory clinics and the rural environment. The emphasis will be on students gaining real clinical experience, participating in patient care and understanding how health care teams work. In the third year, students will study integrated medicine and surgery and pathophysiology which will be taught together with a series of problem-based and core-based learning sessions. The fourth year will be largely taken up with the core clinical rotations of:</p><ul><li> children's health</li><li> general practice</li><li> psychological medicine</li><li> women's health.</li></ul>
<h4 class="black">Year 5D</h4>
<p >The final year of the course focuses on facilitating the students' transition into the medical workplace as a trainee intern and will be structured as a series of clinical rotations. Students will participate in a range of learning experiences designed to substantially enhance their clinical reasoning, diagnostic and case management skills. They will consolidate and enhance their knowledge, clinical skills and professional behaviours in clinically orientated rotations:</p><ul><li> aged care</li><li> emergency medicine</li><li> medicine</li><li> patient safety</li><li> scholarly intensive project</li><li> specialty</li><li> surgery.</li></ul></div>
