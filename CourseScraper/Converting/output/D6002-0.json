Students review academic texts and research papers which represent diverse standpoints in understanding education. Students examine how education researchers position themselves within the field in terms of different theories and understandings of education. Students develop capacities in critical reading, analysis and synthesis and use these to prepare their own well-crafted and well-supported academic arguments in written and oral forms. Through this unit, students explore a topic or theme of interest to them, critically review the evidence related to it and practise building an academic argument related to this theme.",

The unit begins with the identification of issues at each of these spatial and sectoral levels, relevant to the students and their work and roles in education. Opportunities are provided for students to critically engage with theory, contemporary policy documents and accounts that are relevant to the issues they are investigating. Students further define key questions for investigation, gather appropriate data to research the issues and present and share in debates through peer-led forums. Through shared learning, the unit provides an orientation for students to a broad range of debates across education contexts and develops understanding of the complexities in this field.",
