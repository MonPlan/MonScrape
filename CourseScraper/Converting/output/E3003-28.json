It is envisaged that the project may involve design of mechanical components, sensing, actuation and computing elements, a simulated model or similar.  Before work is started on the project a safety induction and/or risk assessment process will be completed. The student will also complete a research proposal or requirements analysis to ensure that the scope and expected outcomes of the project are agreed between student and supervisor. A progress report and a progress presentation at the end of the semester will give a detailed account of progress and a research plan for the next semester.",
