Biostatistics is the science of describing, summarising, and analysing health-related data. It is essential to understand biostatistics in order to  design, conduct, and interpret health-related research. The basic principles and methods used in biostatistics are covered in this unit. This includes the technical qualifications necessary for analysing and interpreting data on a descriptive and bivariate level.Topics include classifying health data; summarising data using simple statistical  methods and  graphical  presentation; sampling distributions; quantifying uncertainty in results from a sample; working with statistical distributions; comparing two or more groups/methods using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests (p - values); assessing the association between an outcome and an exposure using the chi-squared test; using risk comparisons (RR and OR); predicting an event or identifying risk factors for an event of interest where the event is measured on a continuous scale or a binary scale (yes/no).",
