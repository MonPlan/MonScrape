In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight.",

Both fundamental and applied aspects of failure of aircraft structural components will be covered. The unit will detail the damage tolerance design philosophy, and how it fits into airworthiness requirements as described in the relevant Standard (JSSG 2006). The unit focuses on how fracture mechanics principles and modern fatigue crack growth laws are used to meet JSSG2006. To illustrate the effect of cracking on service aircraft we will consider flaw growth in a range of aircraft undergoing both in-service flight loading and full scale fatigue tests.",

As a capstone unit, it should be studied in the final semester of the finance major as it draws upon and integrates learning from previous units studied. The unit encourages students to recognise that finance is a powerful tool for solving our common problems, and increasing the general wellbeing, but may give rise to ethical dilemmas. Students will be exposed to choices and conflicts requiring judgement and thus appreciate that finance can play an important role in helping society achieve it's goals.",
