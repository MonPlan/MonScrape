In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight.",

Both fundamental and applied aspects of failure of aircraft structural components will be covered. The unit will detail the damage tolerance design philosophy, and how it fits into airworthiness requirements as described in the relevant Standard (JSSG 2006). The unit focuses on how fracture mechanics principles and modern fatigue crack growth laws are used to meet JSSG2006. To illustrate the effect of cracking on service aircraft we will consider flaw growth in a range of aircraft undergoing both in-service flight loading and full scale fatigue tests.",
