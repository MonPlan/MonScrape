For a new business, the goal is acquiring investor funding.  In a corporate environment, the methodology will help the organisation start new businesses and allocate their internal resources (time, technology, and talent) more efficiently.  The unit will be taught in a hands-on way that engages student teams by requiring them to develop hypotheses and then test those hypotheses outside the classroom.  Throughout the semester, teams will modify their business models based on feedback from potential customers, and can then decide if there is a worthwhile business to be built.  The unit does not include the execution of the business models.",

The data collected in each lab session, from different experiments and instruments, will be combined throughout the course of the unit with the aim of solving a real materials science problem that is of current interest or a hot topic.Approximately 50% of this unit is based on the flipped classroom, and data analysis from laboratory sessions will be carried out in workshop-style tutorial sessions using the knowledge and instruction gained from the online modules.",

The project will involve a critical assessment of the current literature and will include one or a combination of design, development, and theoretical or experimental investigation work. The project plan and its outcomes will be communicated to a wider audience via a proposal, oral presentations, a progress report and a technical paper. The project may be undertaken either within the faculty or externally with a company or research organisation. This is the second part of a two-unit project.",
