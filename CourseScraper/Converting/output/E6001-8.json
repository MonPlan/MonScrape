For a new business, the goal is acquiring investor funding.  In a corporate environment, the methodology will help the organisation start new businesses and allocate their internal resources (time, technology, and talent) more efficiently.  The unit will be taught in a hands-on way that engages student teams by requiring them to develop hypotheses and then test those hypotheses outside the classroom.  Throughout the semester, teams will modify their business models based on feedback from potential customers, and can then decide if there is a worthwhile business to be built.  The unit does not include the execution of the business models.",

The basic concepts of intelligent control, application of intelligent agents in grid technology, and intelligent components commonly used in Smart Grids are extensively discussed afterward. Also included is how distribution networks adapt to intermittent energy sources (e.g. solar and wind) through the use of smart grids, emerging technologies and energy storage systems.The unit will conclude with defining concept, design and purpose of the Smart Grid, reviewing current and relevant technologies developed, assessing its vulnerabilities to a cyber-attack, and finding effective protective mechanisms for the grid.",

The project will involve a critical assessment of the design problem from engineering as well as non-engineering perspectives. The project work rely on using creative problem solving and decision-making skills and modern project management tools for developing practical solutions to the design problem. The outcomes of the project will be communicated via presentations, demonstrations and reports. This project may be undertaken either within the faculty or with external partners. This is the second part of a two-unit project sequence.",
