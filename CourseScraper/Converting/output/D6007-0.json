The developmental section provides students with an advanced understanding of, in particular, the early stages of human development, the fundamental place of relationships and contexts in typical and atypical psychological development, and developmental trajectories across the lifespan. Emphasis is on child--adolescent development and adult facilitation of development and learning in themselves and others (as in parenting, teaching, mentoring and collaboration). The counselling section covers aspects of counselling that are fundamental to facilitating intervention and change. The research section covers contemporary research methodologies relevant for investigation into all areas of educational and developmental psychology.",

Students critically debate and review contemporary research and theories of abilities, personality and psychopathology as well as ethical, cultural, and professional issues. They gain experience in administering and reporting a range of essential psycho-educational assessment instruments, assessing abilities, personality and adjustment of children from pre-school age to adults in old age. They develop skills in report writing, planning intervention and self-reflection on the processes and professional relationships involved in psychological testing, all developed in a context of peer review and support.",

Consideration is also given to psychosocial factors and parenting programs related to providing support to individuals who are exceptional, their families and their support workers. Practice models in line with government policy on disability assessments and related legal and ethical principles including cross-cultural issues and social justice concerns are also examined.",
