In particular, it analyses how firms position themselves in the market and how they form their output and price decisions on the basis of their understanding of demand and supply conditions, market structures, and strategic interaction with other firms. Finally this unit looks at particular aspects of market failure and the role of government in relation to market failure.",

Students will work closely with a personal supervisor to ensure that the research paper locates and masters new knowledge and demonstrates originality in both research content and intellectual argument.",
