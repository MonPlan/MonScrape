For a new business, the goal is acquiring investor funding.  In a corporate environment, the methodology will help the organisation start new businesses and allocate their internal resources (time, technology, and talent) more efficiently.  The unit will be taught in a hands-on way that engages student teams by requiring them to develop hypotheses and then test those hypotheses outside the classroom.  Throughout the semester, teams will modify their business models based on feedback from potential customers, and can then decide if there is a worthwhile business to be built.  The unit does not include the execution of the business models.",

The concept of estimation from real world data is presented, as opposed to the basic analysis of signals, transfer functions and power spectra. In particular, the fundamentals of linear estimation theory and optimal filtering to design advanced signal processing algorithms are presented.",

The outcomes of the project will be communicated via presentations, demonstrations and reports. This project may be undertaken either within the faculty or with external partners. This is the second part of a two-unit project sequence.",

The project will involve a critical assessment of the current literature and will include one or a combination of design, development, and theoretical or experimental investigation work. The project plan and its outcomes will be communicated to a wider audience via a proposal, oral presentations, a progress report and a technical paper. The project may be undertaken either within the faculty or externally with a company or research organisation. This is the second part of a two-unit project.",
