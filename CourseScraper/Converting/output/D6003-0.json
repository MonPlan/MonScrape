The strong focus on lifespan issues promotes an understanding of others and deeper appreciation of clients and the counselling process. Both historical and contemporary frameworks for lifespan and attachment counselling are explored and their relationship to practice evaluated. Students examine key concepts in attachment theory along with how the main attachment types play out both in childhood and later life. The personal and professional aspects experienced in the counselling profession are investigated together with the impact that counselling has on the identities and functioning of counsellors.",

Students examine applied and academic research and evaluation in relation to mental health issues and counselling, and evaluate the quality of, and approaches used to gather, research evidence. Reflecting and drawing on their current or previous clinical professional experience, students consolidate their skills in case formulation, documenting evidence-based interventions and choosing appropriate assessment tools and instruments. Under supervision, students take up opportunities for self-reflection on their own professional development as counsellors.",
