Overall, this unit is designed to teach students how research is conducted in an ethical manner, how research data is managed and analysed, how rational decisions are made through teamwork and how research can be communicated. It will be taught through three parallel streams (modules) of study:  Communications skills module on skills for written, oral and visual communications and the use of resources to facilitate communications such as the library and data archival systems;  Biostatistics module on research design and methodology, and the use of statistics and data analysis; and  Research ethics and management module on rational decision-making processes applied to managing research/industry projects and understanding the legal and ethical environment in which research is conducted.",
