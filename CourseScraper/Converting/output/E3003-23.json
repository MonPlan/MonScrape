Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue.

The mechanical and thermal properties of ceramics, the structure and production of amorphous ceramics and porous ceramics, the glass transition, optical and electrical properties of glass. The mechanical properties of polymers are very dependent on the timescale and temperature and so the structural basis of linear viscoelasticity and time/temperature superposition are discussed. The mechanical properties of elastomers, crosslinking and reinforcement, rubber elasticity and the tear and fatigue of elastomers. The Eyring theory and methods of toughening polymers are discussed.",

The role of materials identification and selection and the impact on function and environment is covered. In addition it looks at the role computers play in all facets of the current engineering environment, including the key areas of design, analysis, machining and robotics. It seeks to give students practical skills in these areas, in particular in the area of computer-aided drafting.",
