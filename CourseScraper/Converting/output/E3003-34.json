Through attempting larger-scale software development they will learn how the techniques they have encountered in isolation work together as an integrated methodology to make such complex projects feasible.The project will be managed through a heavyweight process model such as the Spiral Model, to ensure students are exposed to a representative example of both heavyweight and lightweight processes (which are covered in FIT2101) through the BSE core.For the first time in their degrees, students will solicit and document requirements from client proxies who are not IT professionals. This builds their communication skills with other stakeholders in preparation for the industry-based project or IBL.",
