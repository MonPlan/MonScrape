Physical, visual and performative integration of building performance systems will be considered in terms of their relationship to design intent. Integral to the subject matter are the implications of tighter integration in relation to strategies for environmental sustainability and optimisation in architectural design and construction. Through project-based exercises, students also engage with the professional ethics and practices required for project development and the performative integration of building systems and design intent.",
