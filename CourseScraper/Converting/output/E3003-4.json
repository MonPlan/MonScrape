The curriculum focuses on general and physical chemistry principles which in turn complements the synthetic chemistry topics discussed in the subsequent unit, CHM1022. On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.",

In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight.",
