This unit explores each individual's values, behaviours and ways of thinking with a mind to understanding the diversity and unique contribution of self and others. Methods of analytical reasoning to address business problems and interpret and produce clear and sound arguments, as well as strategies to support a critical inquiry approach to the learning and research activities throughout the program, will be developed.The challenges of leading and managing change in complex times, and the dynamic ethical challenges that leaders are likely to encounter in their roles are also addressed. Frameworks for organisational leadership and ethical decision-making will be introduced, along with the recognition of the obstacles that prevent success and result in poor decisions and outcomes.",

In the modern world, technology and globalisation are among the primary forces disrupting existing models in every sector of the economy, and executive leadership requires an understanding of this complexity. New systems that combine hardware, sensors, data storage, microprocessors, software, and connectivity impact industry structure and the nature of competition; businesses are increasingly facing new competitive opportunities and threats. Industry boundaries are being reshaped and entirely new industries are being created. This unit introduces and examines business models, the infrastructure and technologies of business, forces of change in the business and competitive environment, the impact on business models and business strategy initiatives and responses.Topic 2: Markets and customersMarkets and customers focuses on analysing markets, customer behaviour and related business strategy, and on developing and executing marketing strategy. In an interactive digital environment, consumer and organisational buying behaviour is critically altered, and appropriate models of marketing are required. The unit explores market orientation, market research and analysis, marketing planning and marketing implementation in a range of contemporary contexts, including industrial and consumer markets and private and public sectors. It also looks at the contribution of marketing activity and thinking to other business functions and activities, including stakeholder and relationship strategy, and takes a strategic approach to marketing leadership.Topic 3: Financial and managerial accountingProfessional managers in every discipline need to understand the role of the accounting function in organisations. Financial and managerial accounting introduces the processes and techniques that enable managers to plan and control organisational activities and make informed, value-enhancing decisions. From a strategic perspective, the topic explores financial performance by introducing a range of techniques used by internal and external stakeholders to assess firm value. It also explores the role of accounting in planning, decision making and performance evaluation, and introduces a range of tools to understand cost behaviour, product pricing, budgeting and performance measurement.",

In high-technology environments, shorter product and service cycles require a leadership focus on agility, quality and flexibility. This unit provides students with the concepts, techniques and tools to design, analyse and improve their operational and project management capabilities. To manage complex projects effectively, students will study and practice the roles of initiating, scoping, coordinating and implementing complex projects in dynamic situations. The pedagogy will include a range of cases and applications. Design thinking is increasingly influential in the field of innovation and organisational development, and will be an integral part of the unit.Topic 2: Economics and societyThe economic lens for reasoning in business is a critical understanding for practising executives and business leaders. In a turbulent, global economy, tackling macroeconomic challenges such as sustainable models, demographic shifts, climate change and income inequality demands economic literacy. This unit covers the main macroeconomic and microeconomic issues for business organisations, including market structures, supply and demand functions and pricing concepts. The importance of social relationships to economics is addressed, and the relationship between economics and politics is explored in the area of the regulatory environment. To access the most advanced ideas in this broad-based field, the unit will draw on the expertise and experience of university colleagues in relevant faculties and related research centres where required.Topic 3: Business financeBusiness finance introduces the resourcing theories and practices that contribute to the sustainable, strategic management of organisations. The unit takes a value-impacting approach to interrelated issues of investment, financing, budgeting and operations. Drawing on cross-disciplinary perspectives and recent advances in theory and practice, Business finance develops frameworks for analysis and decision-making of relevance to executives and managers in contemporary organisations. The unit examines how financial and economic information is used to gain forward intelligence on the ability of the organisation to create sustainable value. An experiential, case-based pedagogy is adopted.",

Organisational change management programs can be complex and difficult; when the situation calls for fundamental and rapid adaptation, the transformation agenda becomes high-level, strategic and immediate.Understanding the systemic relationships between mission, values, strategy, technology, systems and culture requires a deep understanding of organisational behaviour and design. To lead a review and reinvention of an organisation facing critical challenges demands a thorough knowledge of transformation processes. This unit explores and integrates the political, leadership, strategy and integration processes and capabilities required for successful transformation.Topic 2: Business analyticsUnderstanding the sources, uses and value of the flow of information through an organisation can give executives a competitive advantage and drive their innovation. Firms can leverage deep insights into business performance to enhance their value proposition and competitiveness. Business analytics focuses on providing students with a managerial knowledge of the tools, methods and practices used to understand the vast amounts of data available to businesses, and its use in forecasting and in making strategic and operational business decisions. Descriptive and predictive analytics are explored, data mining and data visualisation techniques are addressed, and a wide range of cases are used to demonstrate the application of models and techniques.Topic 3: Global business strategyIn a globalising world, conducting business is increasingly complex. Organisation leaders require robust models to understand globalisation and the implications for 21st century firms. Companies must understand the political, economic and social environments in which they operate. To engage globally, executives need to address a range of critical issues relating to the internationalisation of their business. These include marketing internationally, choosing locations for key activities, new ways of organising international business, and processes for managing across borders.The aim of the unit is to prepare students to manage effectively in a global, interconnected world. it examines the changing international environment for business, the dynamics of international competition, international relations and government-business interactions and the principles and practices of global business strategy. Further, the unit helps the student to develop the ethical and cross-cultural mindset and competence to succeed in global business. Cases and applications address models of global business and the management of innovation in multinational companies and settings; expert policy-makers and practitioners in the field will contribute to the unit.",
