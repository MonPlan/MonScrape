This unit builds upon the scientific concept of disease aetiology explored in Integrated Science Systems (BND2103) and the critical interpretation of scientific literature and research skills developed in years 1 and 2. Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.Student centered teaching and learning methods will be used to support the delivery of the unit content. Students' participation as adult learners will be encouraged through the curricula with emphasis on extending their scientific communication skills.",

Students coming through the cognate path will receive credit for this subject and be eligible to proceed into the 72 CP Masters program.The unit initially focuses on health behaviours, assessment of nutritional status, growth and development, physical activity and nutritional requirements for groups across the lifespan from infancy to old age. The unit will incorporate elements of professional development, cultural competency about food and eating patterns, and content around the Australian food supply system including food regulation and law.Concepts of health education and promotion will enhance students' knowledge and ability to communicate nutrition messages effectively to groups and individuals as well as teamwork and reflection. Students will be introduced to reflective practice, commencing a professional portfolio and will be engaged via adult learning teaching and learning principles as  they begin to develop their professional identity.",
