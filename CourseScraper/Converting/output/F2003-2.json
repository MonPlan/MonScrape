This unit introduces students to various professional processes and outcomes that contemporary visual artists engage and exhibit in. The workshop-driven classes incorporate theoretical and historical perspectives on these gallery-based modes. This unit introduces various steps required to make art public from: studio-based processes; the engagement of critical feedback; administrative processes associated with gallery-based exhibition; installing an artwork; and contextualising the artwork in a considered theoretical and curatorial framework. The workshop program facilitates a support structure for the development and consolidation of experimental approaches to conceptual and material outcomes of burgeoning research interests. Students are required to investigate and develop individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.",

The unit provides students with an advanced perspective on the various modes of publication available to cultural practitioners engaged in Visual Art. This unit gives students an opportunity to incorporate theoretical frameworks that reflect and expand upon a breadth of fields that include education, business, information technology or the liberal arts into their production of visual culture. This unit asks students to develop self-directed strategies that extend upon traditional gallery based exhibition modes. These modes might include: artists' books, editioned objects; site-based research and exhibiting; digital broadcast; collaborative, social and/or performative processes; curatorial contexts; and creative arts writing. The workshop program encourages an experimental and critical approach to conceptual and material outcomes whilst providing opportunities to cultivate curatorial, critical writing and administrative skills. Students are required to initiate individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer-review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.",

In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",
