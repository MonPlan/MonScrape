As a capstone unit, it should be studied in the final semester of the finance major as it draws upon and integrates learning from previous units studied. The unit encourages students to recognise that finance is a powerful tool for solving our common problems, and increasing the general wellbeing, but may give rise to ethical dilemmas. Students will be exposed to choices and conflicts requiring judgement and thus appreciate that finance can play an important role in helping society achieve it's goals.",
