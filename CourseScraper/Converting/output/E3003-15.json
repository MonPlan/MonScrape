A discussion of discrete and continuous random variables, common distributions, functions, and expectations forms an important part of this unit. Transform methods, limit theorems, convergences, and bounding techniques are also covered. Special consideration is given to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Markov chain, transition probabilities and steady state distribution will be discussed.Application examples from engineering, science, and statistics will be provided: The Gaussian distribution in source and channel coding, the exponential, Chi-square, and Gamma distributions in wireless communications and Bayesian statistics, the Rayleigh distribution in wireless communications, the Cauchy distribution in detection theory, the Poisson and Erlang distributions in traffic engineering, queuing theory and networking, the Gaussian, Laplacian and generalized Gaussian distributions in image processing, the Weibull distribution in high voltage engineering and electrical insulation, Markov chain in queuing theory, and first-order Markov process in predictive speech/image compression.",

Mathematical concepts are used to describe the fields, and examine the basic laws governing the generation of fields and their interactions with dielectric and magnetic materials. This study results in Maxwell's field equations, and related Laplace, Poisson and continuity equations. The real life applications of electromagnetic fields in radio communications and devises such as scanners, printers and mass spectrometers are also explored in this unit. Finally, plane wave propagation is analysed briefly as an extension of Maxwell's field equations.",

Students will use knowledge from linear and non-linear electronics, computer engineering and communications engineering, to tackle a group project, applying project management skills, and extending their experience of working in groups. The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.",
