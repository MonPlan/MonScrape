Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue. Microstructural toughening, effects of welds and thermal stability of materials will be addressed in terms of mitigation or minimization of structural defects.",

The major strengthening mechanisms involving interactions of dislocations with obstacles are discussed This unit examines the factors that are important in influencing the structural and chemical changes and the principles for microstructrual design. It demonstrates how to use the design principles to manipulate, in a controlled manner, the alloying additions and thermomechanical processing to tailor the properties and thus the performance of materials.",

In particular, foundry technology and design of castings, welding and design of weldments and approaches  to obtaining high quality 'clean' steel will be addressed. Selection of an appropriate thermomechanical processing schedule in order to achieve the required microstructure and properties of steels will be discussed. The second part of the unit will introduce ceramic processing technologies including green body shaping, solid state sintering, liquid phase sintering, hot-pressing and sol-gel processing. Microstructures of ceramics and their effects on the materials properties will be presented.",
