The unit begins with a review of univariate statistics and introduction to the philosophy of research design and analysis. More advanced statistical techniques are then systematically introduced. There is a focus on the understanding of the issues that may arise around the choice of appropriate statistical technique and preparation of data; critiquing decisions made to assist in the interpretation of findings. The content will be set in a context of the needs of professional psychologists and researchers whose interests present unusual methodological demands, which in turn may influence choices in research approach and statistical technique.",

The thesis introduction/ literature review component of the research report will consist of a description of the students' project, a detailed review of the relevant literature, and a statement of the research hypotheses to be tested. Students will be provided with course materials and guidance to help them produce a high quality research proposal, source and synthesise appropriate research findings, and coherently synthesise this into a research project.
