The curriculum focuses on general and physical chemistry principles which in turn complements the synthetic chemistry topics discussed in the subsequent unit, CHM1022. On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.",

Both fundamental and applied aspects of failure of aircraft structural components will be covered. The unit will detail the damage tolerance design philosophy, and how it fits into airworthiness requirements as described in the relevant Standard (JSSG 2006). The unit focuses on how fracture mechanics principles and modern fatigue crack growth laws are used to meet JSSG2006. To illustrate the effect of cracking on service aircraft we will consider flaw growth in a range of aircraft undergoing both in-service flight loading and full scale fatigue tests.",
