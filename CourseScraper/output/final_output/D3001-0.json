From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

Students develop insights into a range of contemporary programs including but not limited to the Reggio Emilia and Forest Schools approaches. In addition students are introduced to practice guidelines and principles relevant to their specific contexts such as the professional code of ethics, curriculum frameworks and policy documents.  Understandings of daily practice are informed by the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child to uphold the rights of the child and by ethical considerations for respectful, meaningful and quality education and care for children.

In addition, students explore the diverse culturally informed ways in which children in contemporary society play and learn in early childhood settings, primary schools, families and communities. Importantly, students undertake an analysis of the contemporary theories of play and, noting the research upon which a variety of theories are based, examine multicultural variations, popular culture and gendered interactions. They become familiar with a range of children's play contexts. Students further develop their understanding through observing children at play and undertaking analyses of re-theorising play as a pedagogical construct to support students' ability for leading pedagogical practice change.",

The theoretical and practical context of how children learn from birth to eight years of age is explored to support students' capacity for building effective relationships. The focus is on the implications of development for learning and teaching in relation to contemporary issues impacting on children's learning with their family and communities. All aspects of learning and teaching in these early years is examined through participation in problem-based learning scenarios and observed case studies where students analyse and apply knowledge of children, family and communities. Students learn to understand how theoretical and contemporary real-life issues relate to the development of children's learning, and they develop their ability to design innovative learning with children, their families and communities.",

Wellbeing is discussed in terms of holistic approaches to health with children, their families and communities with particular emphasis on diversity and inclusion. There are emphases on physical wellbeing with attention paid to movement, the body, diet and nutrition, outdoor activity and risk taking, as well as children's socio-emotional wellbeing. Local and international perspectives on health and wellbeing are explored and how different cultural values disrupt the idea that there is a universal standard for health and physical wellbeing. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) document underpins the learning in this unit. Students learn how they can develop and apply strategies to ensure the rights of children to a healthy and active lifestyle can be achieved.",

Students learn how to develop personal literacy through integrated approaches and an explicit focus on reading recovery and language development across reading, writing, speaking and listening. Students explore a wide range of literature suitable for children and engage with various approaches to storytelling and language arts, including digital and cross-arts storytelling. Students develop their skills in English and literacy including how to critically analyse texts, how to select and present literature for children and methods of integrating language arts across the curriculum. By developing their own English communication skills as story makers and tellers, students gain the ability to design pedagogies for engaging children in literature and developing literacies through storytelling and to develop literacy leadership.",

The focus of this unit is on the development of skills that facilitate processes of researching and critically analysing, theoretically informed pedagogical strategies to support children through change and transition. By researching the traditions, routines and practices of children's life worlds, students are given the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of children's learning and development in diverse and complex contexts. Students explore possibilities for ethical, innovative and collaborative work with families and other professionals to enable children's mobility and agency across experiences of change and transition.",

It builds on knowledge from earlier units and learning from professional experience across a range of early years educational settings. Exploration of current research literature illuminates the various ways diverse learners can fully and effectively participate within multiple contexts in a contemporary literate society. Emphasis is given to developing further understanding of language pedagogies, theories and strategies related to children's literacy learning including, for example, coding competence, semantic practices, pragmatic competence and critical thinking practices. Students develop the skills and confidence to plan, implement, evaluate and lead literacy initiatives intended to improve children's literacy outcomes across contexts and cultures.",

Students research everyday environments at home and in the community to determine science and technology affordances and apply well-developed judgements for turning everyday concepts into scientific concepts. The teaching of these areas is examined from a range of theoretical perspectives and in relation to relevant regional/national curricula. Attention is paid to learning across the institutional contexts of home, early childhood setting and classrooms and students are expected to research and conceptualise both pedagogies and programs in ways that promote and meaningfully engage young children's learning of science, technology and environment.",

They also draw on research literature to investigate a range of issues including maximising student motivation in schools, engagement through curriculum development and innovative practice, and developing community-based curriculum and practices. Students understand how teachers are 'curriculum workers' constantly responding to change and the implications of this for their professional identity. Students then develop and demonstrate their use of practices that are inclusive, exciting and educational during their course and in their practicum experience.",

Students analyse critically, evaluate and transform information from a range of curricula, including the Australian primary science curriculum and other international curricula. Specifically students recognise that knowledges are culturally constructed and they research a range of world views about science and technology. Important conceptual scientific ideas and different pedagogical approaches to the teaching of science and technology are critiqued. The preparation and teaching of science and technology programs is undertaken in the context of studying teaching strategies that are appropriate across cultural contexts, for different science and technology concepts and across year levels in primary school, early childhood settings, homes and communities.",

Students apply some of the principles and methods of educational research they have learned about by developing a short literature review related to the proposal developed in EDF4100. They then demonstrate their capacity to generate and use data ethically via a research project related to their particular discipline and specialisation. This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation. Finally, students demonstrate a clear and coherent exposition of the knowledge they have gained through the presentation of their findings to their peers and in a written report.",
