The key anatomical features of the integumentary and musculoskeletal systems will be examined as well as their role in the control of homeostasis. The central and peripheral nervous system will be addressed in the context of its physiological characteristics and with special attention to the anatomical features of the spinal cord and brain. Students will be introduced to the various functions of the brain in the context of homeostasis and control, together with the special senses. Throughout the unit, clinical connections will be made with the systems addressed so that students will understand the relevance of the topics included in the unit to the health and human science disciplines.",

Health promotion will be introduced as an approach that uses multiple strategies to empower individuals and communities and create supportive environments for health. The health promotion actions examined will include policy development, community mobilisation, health education and social marketing. The role that partnerships and capacity building play in sustaining action and health outcomes will be investigated. Learning will be facilitated with case examples and consideration will be given to how the methods examined can be applied to current public health priorities.",

Cognitive psychology: the exploration of internal mental processes - e.g., the fallible nature of memory, how it works and is influenced by others. Abnormal psychology: what happens when our thoughts, feelings, or behaviour cause distress, and interfere with our ability to function - e.g., depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.You will also examine how psychologists acquire further knowledge and test their understanding of the way in which individuals think, feel, and behave.
