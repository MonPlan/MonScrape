The role of materials identification and selection and the impact on function and environment is covered.

In particular, foundry technology and design of castings, welding and design of weldments and approaches  to obtaining high quality 'clean' steel will be addressed. Selection of an appropriate thermomechanical processing schedule in order to achieve the required microstructure and properties of steels will be discussed. The second part of the unit will introduce ceramic processing technologies including green body shaping, solid state sintering, liquid phase sintering, hot-pressing and sol-gel processing. Microstructures of ceramics and their effects on the materials properties will be presented.",
