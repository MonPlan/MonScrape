From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

Students examine how the curriculum organises and represents knowledge in ways that are both specialised and interdisciplinary. They explore how teachers help students develop knowledge, capabilities and skills both within and beyond subject specialism boundaries in ways that meet the needs of a diverse range of students in an ever-changing world. Students develop broad knowledge and understanding of legislative requirements and teaching strategies that support participation and learning of students with disabilities. The unit provides a range of conceptual and practical ideas and resources from which students can build further understandings and capacities in their ongoing professional learning as specialist teachers.",

Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in drastically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible.This unit examines a selection of programming languages and paradigms and explores the evolution of language design from low-level paradigms that are closer to the execution model of the machine, to more high-level declarative paradigms that allow programmers to model a problem precisely rather than specify its solution. The unit covers paradigms such as functional and logic programming, comparing and contrasting them to programming styles that students are already familiar with, including object-oriented, imperative and procedural programming paradigms. Topics include specification and data-modeling techniques (covering types and polymorphism, mutability-versus-purity, state management, and side-effects) and different models of execution such as strict-versus-lazy evaluation.The unit provides practical experience with a variety of non-procedural, non-object-oriented programming languages and discusses the influence of programming language theory on the design of current main-stream computer languages, and how the theory translates to practice.",

International policy developments and trends in multicultural education are examined, as well as local, state and national responses. Cultural, linguistic, religious, socioeconomic, intellectual and physical differences among all students are studied in relation to creating equitable and inclusive learning environments.

In association with this exploration, students investigate a range of issues that include maximising learner motivation in schools, engagement through curriculum development and innovative practice, developing community-based curriculas and practices, and teachers seeing themselves as 'curriculum workers' and the implication of this for their professional identity.

They apply their emerging knowledge and skills in these areas to creatively and critically inquire into a range of educational scenarios involving literacy development and learning. Students learn about and undertake ethnographic research into their own literacy practices, and those of students and teachers in diverse educational contexts. In learning from research and through conducting their own inquiries, students develop an appreciation of how language and literacy practices play key roles in mediating diverse learners' identities, relationships and understandings of the world.",

A key focus of this unit is investigating what makes particular curricula and assessment approaches have greater or lesser educative value and the impacts of policy in these areas. Consequently, the political and ethical dimensions inherent in all curricula are explored, as are the linkages between curricula, assessment, reporting, evaluation and the quality of student learning. This unit promotes the importance of developing the professional capacity of educators to make critical judgments in terms of curriculum planning, action and evaluation, and the development of assessment that promotes high quality student learning.",

                    "Sypnosis": "This unit prepares students for their transition from initial teacher education to their professional practice as teachers. Drawing on a range of research literature and the knowledge, skills and professional experiences developed during all years of their course, students are inducted into the notion of what it means to be engaged in the teaching profession through consideration of the nature of teachers' work and of leadership in education. This includes the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and personal dimensions of the work of teachers and educational leaders. Students gather evidence of and critically reflect on their emerging professional identity as practitioners, and on the Graduate Teaching Standards and graduate attributes they have developed that enable them to be skilled teachers and potential education leaders. They explore the ways in which they can engage with and initiate professional communities of educators in and beyond their immediate professional settings. Students develop understanding of the process of applying for positions and transitioning to the profession in ways that enhance and improve their employability. They continue to develop their literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology (ICT) skills and knowledge through synthesising a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives they have encountered throughout their course.",
