It explores the key threats to sustainability, such as climate change, human migration, resource scarcity and emerging diseases. Core concepts covered in the unit include those of scale, systems and complexity.The unit teaches problem structuring methods, evidence-based approaches and methods of interpreting risk and uncertainty. Particular emphasis is placed on developing skills to integrate evidence into sustainability actions across multiple sectors, systems and scales. Theory will be complemented with group learning exercises, professional development activities and engagement with practitioners.",

How sustainability is viewed and addressed is shaped by a diversity of multi-stakeholder perspectives and value systems along with their capacity to influence economic, regulatory, and policy regimes.This unit develops student's capacity to map and critically analyse: multi-stakeholders and social structures affecting sustainability; different ideological, cultural, philosophical, psychological and disciplinary perspectives on sustainability; and, their implications for policymaking, development of business cases, disciplinary research, and action.",
