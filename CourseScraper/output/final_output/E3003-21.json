Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue. Microstructural toughening, effects of welds and thermal stability of materials will be addressed in terms of mitigation or minimization of structural defects.",
