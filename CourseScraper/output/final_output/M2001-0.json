They will be engaged via adult learning teaching and learning principles in this unit as they begin to develop their professional identity. This unit will commence students on the pathway to becoming experts in food (knowledge and application) and culturally competent, self aware healthcare professionals.Food and culture will provide the core content for students to apply, integrate and develop/extend personal and professional attributes and competencies, communication and interpersonal skills. Enhanced cultural awareness for students will be a key outcome of this unit and this will be contextualized as students learn about food/food ingredients, eating patterns, why we eat what we eat and the Australian food supply system. Interprofessional learning opportunities with other healthcare profession students will help strengthen the learning in this unit. Students will be introduced to reflective practice and commence a professional portfolio.",

The areas of pharmacology and genetics will be included as the role of nutrition in these sciences is increasingly emphasised. The key theme explored in this unit is Theme 3: Nutrition Fundamentals of Health and Disease coupled with partial integration of content and application from Theme 1: Personal Development and Professional Practice and Theme 4: Food from Science to systems. This unit will take a scientific approach to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the human body in growth and development and the impact of dietary input on cellular and metabolic processes whilst recognising the neuroendocrine control of nutrients within the body and the role of essential micronutrients in immune function. Teaching will focus on a case based learning approach to knowledge application.",

Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.Student centered teaching and learning methods will be used to support the delivery of the unit content.
