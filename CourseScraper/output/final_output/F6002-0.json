These skills and strategies include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to investigate and reconsider the context in which we work and live, as well as potential for innovation.  Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques. The course is delivered partly on-line, with lectures and workshops offering key activities supporting students' learning.",

By providing opportunities for students to participate in leading industrial projects, designing interactive artefacts, systems or services, students will be exposed to specifically situated problems and evaluate innovative solutions that weave together technology, place and product with specific intents in specific contexts.The unit encourages experimentation and skill development with tangible materials and interactive technology via data gathering, analysis, evaluation and design. Students will produce publication quality designs which examine the extension of physical artefacts and tangible interface as elements of connectivity that help users to mediate between the information world and everyday life.The project supports students in a broad range of interests, including the application of advanced technologies, electronics and programming, physical or virtual interface manipulation, and material and engineering fabrication.",
