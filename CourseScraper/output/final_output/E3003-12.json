A computational approach is employed to teach the concepts of statistics, and decision making in the presence of uncertainty.  An important aspect will be to develop skills for compiling data from multiple sources to support better decisions and models. Topics covered will include simulation and randomisation methods, decision and credibility theory, data wrangling and visualisation, methods for time series, Bayesian analysis and models for risk and loss distributions.",

The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.",
