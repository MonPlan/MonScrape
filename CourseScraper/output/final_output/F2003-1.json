Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their personal direction and evolving art practice. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts. Lecturers facilitate students' own exploration, primarily through personal tuition where detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place. Whilst providing a stimulating and supportive environment this unit provides a bridge between students' experience in the supervised studio and a fully-fledged independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as fine artists in the discipline of choice, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",
