They will be engaged via adult learning teaching and learning principles in this unit as they begin to develop their professional identity. This unit will commence students on the pathway to becoming experts in food (knowledge and application) and culturally competent, self aware healthcare professionals.Food and culture will provide the core content for students to apply, integrate and develop/extend personal and professional attributes and competencies, communication and interpersonal skills. Enhanced cultural awareness for students will be a key outcome of this unit and this will be contextualized as students learn about food/food ingredients, eating patterns, why we eat what we eat and the Australian food supply system. Interprofessional learning opportunities with other healthcare profession students will help strengthen the learning in this unit. Students will be introduced to reflective practice and commence a professional portfolio.",

The key theme explored in this unit is Theme 2: Determinants and Influences on Population Health and Nutrition coupled with partial integration of content and application from Theme 1: Personal Development and Professional Practice and Theme 3: Nutrition Fundamentals of Health and Disease.",
