This unit introduces students to the theoretical methodological and ethical issues that underpin contemporary global public health and health science research. It provides direction and guidance to honours students in identifying a meaningful research question and develops the skills and knowledge students need to develop a research proposal. It re-introduces students to quantitative and qualitative research frameworks and data analysis techniques they need both to undertake their study and write a research report.",

Seminars will focus on topics such as current public health thinking and practice. Global and local dimensions of health, as well as on skills in evidence appraisal and systematic searching. Students will be active learners with the presentation of seminars to the class during the semester, and leading the discussion that follows. Students will provide a written review of a topic that is related to their specific research project that demonstrates advanced theoretical understanding of the issues and research relating to that topic.",

Students will be expected to demonstrate initiative and independence during their research study. All Honours students are required to present on their research project at a research seminar prior to submission. The Honours thesis is designed for students who are intending to undertake further higher degree studies. Graduates who have successfully completed the Health Science Research Project (both Part 1 and Part 2) will be able to use their 15,000 word study as evidence of independent research experience in an application for entry into higher research degree programs.",
