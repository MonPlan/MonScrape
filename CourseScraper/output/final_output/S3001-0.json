The aim of this extended project is for students to develop a creative solution enabling the application of scientific research to the needs of society. Students will negotiate a project scope with a research scientist within the Science Faculty that directly draws upon their research, meets the aims of the BSc - Global Challenges (Honours) and falls under one of three project themes: 1) A new product or service utilising the scientific research; 2) Closing the gap between science and policy/politics; 3) Science communication to the general public. During the course of this unit students will also be required to submit their final internship project plans.",
