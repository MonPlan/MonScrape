A computational approach is employed to teach the concepts of statistics, and decision making in the presence of uncertainty.  An important aspect will be to develop skills for compiling data from multiple sources to support better decisions and models. Topics covered will include simulation and randomisation methods, decision and credibility theory, data wrangling and visualisation, methods for time series, Bayesian analysis and models for risk and loss distributions.",

The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

It includes use of design software tools for 3D modeling, assembly, finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and design optimization. Topics on manufacturing processes will incorporate the discussion of a variety of modern computer controlled processes in addition to those relating to composites and polymers. The unit will emphasize design methodologies and processes for low cost, manufacturability, ease of assembly and speed to market.",
