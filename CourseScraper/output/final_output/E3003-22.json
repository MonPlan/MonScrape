Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue. Microstructural toughening, effects of welds and thermal stability of materials will be addressed in terms of mitigation or minimization of structural defects.",

The role of materials identification and selection and the impact on function and environment is covered. In addition it looks at the role computers play in all facets of the current engineering environment, including the key areas of design, analysis, machining and robotics. It seeks to give students practical skills in these areas, in particular in the area of computer-aided drafting.",
