The unit compares review of the 'merits' of administrative actions, by administrative tribunals, with review of their 'legality', by courts, pursuant to judicial review. The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application.
