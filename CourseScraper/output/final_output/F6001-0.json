Students will demonstrate mastery of design research as a synthetic process encompassing a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: form, material, structure, program, site, history and representation architectural form. Studies in the unit will maintain a focus on developing design as a visual language and process of cultural production with an emphasis on social and environmental sustainability.",
