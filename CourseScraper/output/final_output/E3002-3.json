Topics include two and multi-level combinational logic, decoders, multiplexers, arithmetic circuits, programmable and steering logic, flip-flops, registers, counters, RAM and ROM. Using this hardware the design component will include finite state machine design and applications to computer data path control. This will incorporate simple analogue and digital I/O interfacing. Programmable logic devices will be covered, and the use of a hardware description language for describing, synthesizing and testing digital logic. Laboratories cover logic design, implementation, and testing.",

The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.",
