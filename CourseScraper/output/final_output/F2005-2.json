This unit aims to give students a sound basic knowledge of the web and a range of issues which may be involved in web application development. It will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology, design and implementation problems a developer needs to address in developing applications for real-world systems. The diversity of web applications means that there are a wide range of issues which may be relevant to the development of any given web site. The unit will aim to give breadth of coverage of these issues, rather than focusing in depth on any particular development task or any specific type of web application.The unit will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology issues involved, and highlight the key issues which a developer needs to address in developing applications of this kind for real-world systems.",

Through using research processes appropriate to their discipline, students will investigate contemporary issues that penetrate the links between design, society and the environment. They will be required to use their research to uncover existing knowledge; use it to articulate and substantiate an argument; and build on it to formulate their own critically informed ideas. Through acquired research skills students will be able to interrogate a range of contemporary design issues drawn from the perceived moral dichotomies of design: useful/useless, social conscience/private indulgence, essential need/unnecessary consumption, luxury/necessity, and so on.",
