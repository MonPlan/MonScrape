This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual and material outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

What do managers do, and how do I become a good manager? What are the effects of management practice on employees and their experience of being managed? Key contemporary issues of globalisation and cultural diversity, ethics and social responsibility affect the answers to these questions and are therefore woven throughout the curriculum.

This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which develops a variety of methodologies and their contribution to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to further develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to synthesise research interests, building on VPR1113. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented to extend and further foster creative research skills and consolidate students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to further extend each student's capacity for production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual, material and public outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

The workshop program facilitates a support structure for the development and consolidation of experimental approaches to conceptual and material outcomes of burgeoning research interests.

The unit provides students with an advanced perspective on the various modes of publication available to cultural practitioners engaged in Visual Art. This unit gives students an opportunity to incorporate theoretical frameworks that reflect and expand upon a breadth of fields that include education, business, information technology or the liberal arts into their production of visual culture. This unit asks students to develop self-directed strategies that extend upon traditional gallery based exhibition modes. These modes might include: artists' books, editioned objects; site-based research and exhibiting; digital broadcast; collaborative, social and/or performative processes; curatorial contexts; and creative arts writing. The workshop program encourages an experimental and critical approach to conceptual and material outcomes whilst providing opportunities to cultivate curatorial, critical writing and administrative skills. Students are required to initiate individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer-review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.",

In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",
