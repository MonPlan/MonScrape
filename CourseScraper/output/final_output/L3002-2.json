The theory of elasticity is then introduced covering; stress and strain at a point, the transformation of stresses and strains and the calculation of principal stresses and strains; the constitutive relationship between elastic stress-strain behaviour; Mohr's circle; and failure criterion with specific reference to pressure vessels.",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorized transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.",

The unit compares review of the 'merits' of administrative actions, by administrative tribunals, with review of their 'legality', by courts, pursuant to judicial review. The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application.

The unit also examines the way that lawyers' ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering. Students will also be expected to critically assess the way lawyers' ethics are regulated in the context of multiple approaches to legal ethics and disparate practice contexts.",
