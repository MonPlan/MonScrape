Students will compare and contrast a range of solutions to global challenges in different historical, linguistic, cultural, and geographical settings, focusing especially on developing an understanding of effective leadership across a range of contexts. They will develop the skills necessary to critically engage with a range of sources that theorise and reflect on leadership, drawing on a variety of disciplinary approaches. In the workshops students will be encouraged reflect on, then critically engage with, specific examples of successful social change.",
