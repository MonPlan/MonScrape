The aim is to provide students with a practical understanding of this major corporate strategy. The finance issues will involve an examination of basic theory and empirical findings associated with mergers and acquisitions, the valuation of firms under a range of techniques, the structuring of bids from a financing perspective and defensive strategies. The taxation, accounting and legal issues include a review of the taxation effects from the position of both the bidder and the target's shareholders, the legal responsibilities of the Board and senior management of both target and bidder companies, the role of the Takeover Panel in relation to both defensive and negotiating strategies, the use of independent experts, the application of the Trade Practices Act and the effect of the accounting asset impairment tests.",
