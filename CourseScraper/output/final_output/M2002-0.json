The key anatomical features of the integumentary and musculoskeletal systems will be examined as well as their role in the control of homeostasis. The central and peripheral nervous system will be addressed in the context of its physiological characteristics and with special attention to the anatomical features of the spinal cord and brain. Students will be introduced to the various functions of the brain in the context of homeostasis and control, together with the special senses.

Health promotion will be introduced as an approach that uses multiple strategies to empower individuals and communities and create supportive environments for health. The health promotion actions examined will include policy development, community mobilisation, health education and social marketing. The role that partnerships and capacity building play in sustaining action and health outcomes will be investigated. Learning will be facilitated with case examples and consideration will be given to how the methods examined can be applied to current public health priorities.",
