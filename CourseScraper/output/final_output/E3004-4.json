We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

The methods for developing the equations of motion of a vibratory system using Newton's 2nd law and the Lagrange equation and the manipulation of these equations to analyse the free and forced vibration responses of these systems will be introduced.  The analysis of forced vibrations will include periodic and non-periodic forcing functions.",

The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows.

Geometric and economic tolerancing is further explored. The use of solid modeling software to simulate the behaviour of mechanical devices and produce engineering drawings is introduced. The integration of design skills and related engineering studies is covered through a group exercise to design a mechanical device.",

Orientation is to predicting, examining and assessing system performance via formation of mathematical models and solution of models. Laboratory experiments and hands-on instruction in the digital simulation package Matlab to solve models. A unified approach to mathematical modelling via the concepts of resistance, capacitance and inertia/inductance is emphasised. Students learn to perform system modelling, develop solution, assess a system response and analyse systems.",
