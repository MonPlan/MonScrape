These include biological, psychological, and social factors, as well as behaviours such as binge drinking and inappropriate drug use, which can affect both individual health and have wider impact on the community. This unit will employ diverse teaching and learning methods to examine the history of asylums, the move towards deinstitutionalisation, and other advancements in psychological theory and practice that have promoted a push towards community-based mental health care delivery. Students will gain an understanding of the most prevalent mental health issues within the community, including depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol misuse, eating disorders, personality disorders, and psychosis. Common lifespan and developmental challenges for children, adolescents, young adults, and older adults will be discussed.Students will gain an appreciation of how the mental health system works within Australia, the types of community-based organisations, services, and resources available to individuals experiencing a mental health issue, and the barriers that interfere with mental health promotion and recovery from an episode of illness. In undertaking the unit, students will gain familiarity with real life problems faced by people who struggle with mental health difficulties, skills in critical thinking relevant to mental health and wellbeing, and the capacity to analyse responses to particular social and mental health problems.The unit will provide students with knowledge to enable them to participate in the multidisciplinary workforce that address these issues in local, state, and federal government departments, as well as in NGOs, small community-based organisations, and other setting where psychologists work.",

Cognitive psychology: the exploration of internal mental processes - e.g., the fallible nature of memory, how it works and is influenced by others. Abnormal psychology: what happens when our thoughts, feelings, or behaviour cause distress, and interfere with our ability to function - e.g., depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.You will also examine how psychologists acquire further knowledge and test their understanding of the way in which individuals think, feel, and behave. This will involve an introduction to research methodology (e.g., research design, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics).",

This material is taught through four successive themes that progressively build up the discipline knowledge and broader organisation, communication and management skills of science. Themes 1 and 2 (Foundations) explain cell structure and nerve organisation and function. Theme 3 (Communication systems) develops that knowledge base to study fast and slow inter-cell communication systems. Theme 4 (Sensory systems) shows how the systems of touch, pain, hearing, vision, taste and smell detect the world and how the brain analyses that information. Theme 5 (Control and response systems) details how the body responds through movement of limbs and the action of internal organs, and hormone systems. Normal physiology and common dysfunctions of the systems are studied, to allow for a greater understanding of the normal physiology, and an appreciation of dysfunctions.",

Social psychology concepts that will be covered include: 1) social cognition and influence; 2) social identity and attribution; 3) group dynamics and intergroup behaviour; 4) attitude and attitude change; and, 5) attraction and aggression. In each case, these theories will be applied and critiqued in light of contemporary evidence.

Structural and functional changes in nervous system function occur throughout development, adulthood and in disease states associated with neural dysfunction. This course seeks to: focus on specific examples of plastic changes in nervous system function; identify and describe mechanisms contributing to neuronal plasticity; develop an understanding of functional physiological and pathophysiological consequences of neuronal plasticity. We will explore neuronal plasticity at the cellular and neural circuit level associated with higher brain function, such as learning and memory, motor control, cognition and consciousness, and how disruption and dysfunction of neural circuit function contributes to disease states including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease and traumatic brain injury-induced epilepsy. At the level of the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord, functional plasticity underlying the development of chronic pain states will be described. Throughout the course, an emphasis is placed on the use of state-of-the-art research and diagnostic technologies to investigate neural function, including imaging techniques. Emphasis is on assisted self-directed and project based learning.",
