The thermal sciences disciplines are central to mechanical and aerospace engineering, being used in the design and analysis of energy conversion devices and systems. Inevitably, in those conversion processes involving heat, analysis and consequent design requires an understanding of the basic heat transfer mechanisms. Thus, the unit is core to understanding aircraft propulsion and computational heat and fluid flow at later year levels.",

The unit will develop an understanding of the translation of aerodynamic and ground loading on aircraft wings and fuselage to the overall airframe.  An understanding of the concept of structural idealisation and constraint will be developed along with real-world limitations. The principles of stressed skin construction will be considered in detail. The unit aims to develop an understanding of the analysis and design of structural problems common in the aerospace industry. It will provide students with the tools necessary to analyse aircraft structures.",
