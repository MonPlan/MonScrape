Both single and multi-degrees of freedom and discrete and continuous vibratory systems will be analysed.  The methods for developing the equations of motion of a vibratory system using Newton's 2nd law and the Lagrange equation and the manipulation of these equations to analyse the free and forced vibration responses of these systems will be introduced.  The analysis of forced vibrations will include periodic and non-periodic forcing functions.",

Using control volume analysis the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy are developed leading to the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Techniques employed to solving these equations for specific problems are explored. Methods of exact and approximate solutions of these equations, and the use of conceptual and analytical tools such as flow similitude, vorticity, circulation, stream function and velocity potential are described. The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

The unit also examines the way that lawyers' ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering.

It is a full year project of either a major design, theoretical, or experimental investigation. The project may be undertaken either within the department or externally with a company or research organisation. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor. While some projects may benefit from group based work it is expected that students will work individually on each project.",
