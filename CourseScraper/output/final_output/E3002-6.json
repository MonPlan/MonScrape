Using control volume analysis the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy are developed leading to the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Techniques employed to solving these equations for specific problems are explored. Methods of exact and approximate solutions of these equations, and the use of conceptual and analytical tools such as flow similitude, vorticity, circulation, stream function and velocity potential are described. The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

Mechanical, electrical, fluid pressure devices and complete elementary control systems are included. Orientation is to predicting, examining and assessing system performance via formation of mathematical models and solution of models. Laboratory experiments and hands-on instruction in the digital simulation package Matlab to solve models. A unified approach to mathematical modelling via the concepts of resistance, capacitance and inertia/inductance is emphasised. Students learn to perform system modelling, develop solution, assess a system response and analyse systems.",
