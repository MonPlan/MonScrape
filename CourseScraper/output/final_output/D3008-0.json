From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

This unit focuses on the range of ways children encounter and use literacy in a diverse social, cultural and technological world. It introduces conceptual frameworks for understanding and critiquing the processes of how children learn about literacy. Students explore the importance of translating home and community learning into various institutional settings and vice versa. The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives, and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children's literacy learning. With a particular focus on the early years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children's oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies, taking into account issues related to information and communication technology.",

They explore and utilise education programs which have successfully engaged with learners from Indigenous and traditionally oriented societies and achieved improvements in their education outcomes. Students also develop broad knowledge, understanding and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their histories, cultures and languages, to meet expectations in the Australian Curriculum and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.

Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in drastically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible.This unit examines a selection of programming languages and paradigms and explores the evolution of language design from low-level paradigms that are closer to the execution model of the machine, to more high-level declarative paradigms that allow programmers to model a problem precisely rather than specify its solution. The unit covers paradigms such as functional and logic programming, comparing and contrasting them to programming styles that students are already familiar with, including object-oriented, imperative and procedural programming paradigms. Topics include specification and data-modeling techniques (covering types and polymorphism, mutability-versus-purity, state management, and side-effects) and different models of execution such as strict-versus-lazy evaluation.The unit provides practical experience with a variety of non-procedural, non-object-oriented programming languages and discusses the influence of programming language theory on the design of current main-stream computer languages, and how the theory translates to practice.",

Students learn why and how inclusive classroom communities can be created. Students are supported to develop an inclusive disposition to student differences. They develop  knowledge and understanding of repertoire of inclusive strategies for differentiating teaching in order to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities and to ensure they can maximise  the learning outcomes and full participation of all students. They also develop and demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of legislative requirements and teaching strategies that support participation and learning of students with disability.",

The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children's literacy learning. With a particular focus on the middle and upper primary years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children's oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies taking into account issues related to information and communication technologies (ICT).",

Students develop an appreciation for how education for sustainability has emerged as a global priority by exploring research and curriculum content and policy including goals and agreements developed by the United Nations and other education providers in this field. Students develop an understanding of the concepts of environmental studies and sustainability and explore how these concepts are inextricably linked. They learn how to develop integrated approaches to studies of the environment and sustainability and specific related science content across primary school curriculum. Students investigate and understand the cultural, social, economic, scientific, ecological and political factors that influence attitudes and actions towards environment and sustainability. They develop theoretical, discipline-based and pedagogical knowledge and understanding of how to implement whole school approaches and classroom learning experiences for environment and sustainability at different levels of primary education.",

Students apply some of the principles and methods of educational research they have learned about by developing a short literature review related to the proposal developed in EDF4100. They then demonstrate their capacity to generate and use data ethically via a research project related to their particular discipline and specialisation. This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation. Finally, students demonstrate a clear and coherent exposition of the knowledge they have gained through the presentation of their findings to their peers and in a written report.",
