The approach taken is to address core ecological theory, but with an emphasis on contemporary management issues and applications. Topics include the scope and approaches of ecological enquiry; abiotic and biotic factors determining distributions; population growth and regulation; species interactions; patterns and maintenance of biodiversity; food web analysis; disturbance and succession; and production ecology and nutrient cycling. Particular emphasis is placed on integrating ecological processes across spatial and temporal scales. Practical work will be completed via a field excursion together with in-laboratory practical sessions.",

A critical aspect of this unit will be class discussions, where participation in broad ranging debate will be actively encouraged for all students. Communication skills are critical for environmental issues in engineering, as there are commonly differences of opinion with regards to environmental risks as well as their respective solutions. This unit seeks to unify environmental risk assessment in an engineering context.",
