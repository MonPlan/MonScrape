We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

This unit conveys some of this fundamental knowledge related to the analysis and design of engineering structures. It builds on aspects taught in the level 1 unit ENG1001. Topics covered include; bending moment diagrams of determinate and indeterminate beam/frame systems, the calculation of normal stresses due to combined bi-axial bending and axial forces (including those resulting from thermal loading); partial and fully plastic section moment capacities; torsion, shear stress and shear flow in beams; and the calculation of deflections in simple determinate beams. The theory of elasticity is then introduced covering; stress and strain at a point, the transformation of stresses and strains and the calculation of principal stresses and strains; the constitutive relationship between elastic stress-strain behaviour; Mohr's circle; and failure criterion with specific reference to pressure vessels.",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorized transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.",

The objective is to utilise this knowledge to undertake a multi-disciplinary open ended design task for a specified civil engineering development, in groups, mirroring the expectations of working in professional practice. The design project will vary from year to year but will include aspects of structural, water, geomechanics, environmental engineering and transport design with an emphasis on sustainable design.",
