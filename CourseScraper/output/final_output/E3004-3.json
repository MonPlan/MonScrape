We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

Students are introduced to the basics of solid mechanics in a Materials Science and Engineering perspective. The first part of this unit focuses on the mathematical description of stress, strain, and the relationship between them through material models. Topics that will be covered include the theory of linear elasticity, failure criteria, and an introduction to plasticity and viscoelasticity theory. The second part of this unit describes the deformation behaviour of materials from an experimental point of view. Topics include hardening behaviour, ductile and brittle facture, creep and fatigue. A basic introduction to fracture mechanics is also provided.",

Selection of an appropriate thermomechanical processing schedule in order to achieve the required microstructure and properties of steels will be discussed. The second part of the unit will introduce ceramic processing technologies including green body shaping, solid state sintering, liquid phase sintering, hot-pressing and sol-gel processing. Microstructures of ceramics and their effects on the materials properties will be presented.",
