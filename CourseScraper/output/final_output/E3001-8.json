This will also provide an introduction to the underpinning fundamental physical, chemical and transport processes, to demonstrate the influence of raw materials and market needs on processes and products, and the importance of the coordination between mining and processing. The processes used will apply to all minerals: metals, non-metals, coal and the aggregate.A combination of a project based approach together with a sequence of sample tutorials, to provide practice and experience in the use of analysis and design tools, will be employed.",

As part of the design process a range of factors based on site-specific geological, geographical and engineering conditions are considered, including surface features, layout, equipment selection, staffing and scheduling, cost estimation, risk analysis, sustainability and community expectations. Specialised design software is used for short- and long-term planning to facilitate the design process. The design is undertaken by teams which are required to prepare and present a feasibility study report. Teamwork, project management and presentations skills are assessed, in addition to the technical analysis and content of the final design.",
