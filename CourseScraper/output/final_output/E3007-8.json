Students will learn how to decide upon and document their team's structure and their process model. They will be expected to follow the process model they have documented, and to evaluate its effectiveness.There are many factors that can potentially cause a software project to fail. This unit will equip students with techniques to identify and manage these risks, and will take a risk-focused approach to project organisation.",
