From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

It builds students' understanding of the psychological, motivational, social, cognitive, biological and socio-cultural perspectives of child and adolescent development and the possible implications for learning. Students inquire into strategies for learning and teaching with children and adolescents based on contemporary knowledge of development and fostering positive behaviour interactions and relationships for diverse learners. They develop understanding of how to develop a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers and other community service and health providers in the educative process.",

The relationship among science, technology and society is explored, and the nature of science as a discipline is considered. Students build understanding of and demonstrate capacities to plan for science learning and teaching related to the Victorian and Australian curriculum from Foundation to Year 8.",

Students develop understanding of what legislative requirements must be met, e.g. ensuring students' wellbeing and safety, anti-discrimination and equity laws. They explore how policies can impact on meeting diverse learners' needs and how they can be supported to ensure social justice, inclusion and equity for students from varied linguistic, cultural, religious and socio-economic backgrounds. Students examine the Melbourne Declaration on the Educational Goals for Young Australians and other federal and state policies that aim to develop curriculum and practice emphases in line with key priorities for education in Australia. Students also examine how a range of policies (including the cross-curriculum priority areas: developing understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, histories, cultures and learner needs, developing education for sustainability, studies of Asia and the ethical use of information and communication technologies) are enacted at the school and classroom levels.",

Students explore how the humanities and social sciences are represented in national and local curriculum and how the learning area is taught in various ways throughout primary and secondary years. They engage with theoretical, philosophical, pedagogical viewpoints and assessment strategies that address issues deriving from the relevant curriculum frameworks, including the cross-curriculum priorities. Students also learn and develop the skills of lesson planning and implementation of curriculum in the learning area through single-disciplinary and/or integrated studies, using inquiry methodology.",

The teaching of these areas is examined from a range of theoretical perspectives and in relation to relevant regional/national curricula. Attention is paid to learning across the institutional contexts of home, early childhood setting and classrooms and students are expected to research and conceptualise both pedagogies and programs in ways that promote and meaningfully engage young children's learning of science, technology and environment.",

This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation.

Drawing on a range of research literature and the knowledge, skills and professional experiences developed during all years of their course, students are inducted into the notion of what it means to be engaged in the teaching profession through consideration of the nature of teachers' work and of leadership in education. This includes the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and personal dimensions of the work of teachers and educational leaders. Students gather evidence of and critically reflect on their emerging professional identity as practitioners, and on the Graduate Teaching Standards and graduate attributes they have developed that enable them to be skilled teachers and potential education leaders. They explore the ways in which they can engage with and initiate professional communities of educators in and beyond their immediate professional settings. Students develop understanding of the process of applying for positions and transitioning to the profession in ways that enhance and improve their employability. They continue to develop their literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology (ICT) skills and knowledge through synthesising a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives they have encountered throughout their course.",

Students engage with research on how students learn and develop strategies for addressing more complex learning needs, including differentiating learning tasks, setting challenging tasks for more able children, and designing authentic learning projects that promote integrated learning.

In particular, this unit offers students opportunities to further develop pedagogical content knowledge relevant to their chosen disciplinary field(s) and examine engaging and innovative approaches to teaching and learning within the constraints of externally moderated senior secondary curriculum.
