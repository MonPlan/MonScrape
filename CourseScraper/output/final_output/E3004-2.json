We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

                    "Sypnosis": "This unit extends the level of complexity of electronic design by integrating and applying knowledge from a number of second year units. Students will use knowledge from linear and non-linear electronics, computer engineering and communications engineering, to tackle a group project, applying project management skills, and extending their experience of working in groups. The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.",
