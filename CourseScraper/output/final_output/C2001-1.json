This unit introduces the main kinds of information graphics and interactive visualisation systems and their areas of application. It investigates the reasons why visualisation can be effective and based on this students will gain experience in critically assessing data visualisations and in designing their own visualisations. Students will learn how to create visualisations with representative computer tools and gain experience in creating a data visualisation for an application domain of their choice.",
