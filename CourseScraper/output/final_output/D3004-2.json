From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

Another focus is developing and applying the practical teaching knowledge and skills students are acquiring in their course and during professional experience. Unit learning and assessment tasks require students to engage with contemporary issues in teaching, to develop a critical position on these issues, and to consider the practical applications of this position in their teaching practice now and into the future.",

Students examine how the curriculum organises and represents knowledge in ways that are both specialised and interdisciplinary. They explore how teachers help students develop knowledge, capabilities and skills both within and beyond subject specialism boundaries in ways that meet the needs of a diverse range of students in an ever-changing world. Students develop broad knowledge and understanding of legislative requirements and teaching strategies that support participation and learning of students with disabilities.

International policy developments and trends in multicultural education are examined, as well as local, state and national responses. Cultural, linguistic, religious, socioeconomic, intellectual and physical differences among all students are studied in relation to creating equitable and inclusive learning environments. The unit builds understanding of the histories, cultures and identities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and explores how this understanding in educators can productively contribute to experiences of schooling for all young Australians.",

In association with this exploration, students investigate a range of issues that include maximising learner motivation in schools, engagement through curriculum development and innovative practice, developing community-based curriculas and practices, and teachers seeing themselves as 'curriculum workers' and the implication of this for their professional identity. Students draw on their emerging understandings of curriculum policies, issues and innovation to develop practices that are inclusive, exciting and educational.",

Drawing on a range of Australian and international research literature, and linking theory and practice, students work collaboratively and individually to develop deep understandings of language and literacy (including numerical literacy) as complex social, cultural, political and technological practices that develop in multiple contexts, in and out of schools and classrooms. They apply their emerging knowledge and skills in these areas to creatively and critically inquire into a range of educational scenarios involving literacy development and learning. Students learn about and undertake ethnographic research into their own literacy practices, and those of students and teachers in diverse educational contexts. In learning from research and through conducting their own inquiries, students develop an appreciation of how language and literacy practices play key roles in mediating diverse learners' identities, relationships and understandings of the world.",

Consequently, the political and ethical dimensions inherent in all curricula are explored, as are the linkages between curricula, assessment, reporting, evaluation and the quality of student learning.

Students apply some of the principles and methods of educational research they have learned about by developing a short literature review related to the proposal developed in EDF4100. They then demonstrate their capacity to generate and use data ethically via a research project related to their particular discipline and specialisation. This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation. Finally, students demonstrate a clear and coherent exposition of the knowledge they have gained through the presentation of their findings to their peers and in a written report.",

Drawing on a range of research literature and the knowledge, skills and professional experiences developed during all years of their course, students are inducted into the notion of what it means to be engaged in the teaching profession through consideration of the nature of teachers' work and of leadership in education. This includes the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and personal dimensions of the work of teachers and educational leaders. Students gather evidence of and critically reflect on their emerging professional identity as practitioners, and on the Graduate Teaching Standards and graduate attributes they have developed that enable them to be skilled teachers and potential education leaders. They explore the ways in which they can engage with and initiate professional communities of educators in and beyond their immediate professional settings. Students develop understanding of the process of applying for positions and transitioning to the profession in ways that enhance and improve their employability. They continue to develop their literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology (ICT) skills and knowledge through synthesising a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives they have encountered throughout their course.",
