Students will integrate this knowledge into occupational therapy and related theories and models of practice. Students will be required to develop clinical questions, and acquire knowledge and skills from the process of describing and evaluating occupational performance, and critiquing assessment tools for evaluating occupational engagement and occupational performance.
