Ecology and biodiversity forms the foundation for understanding conservation and the management of genetics, species and ecosystem diversity. The approach taken is to address core ecological theory, but with an emphasis on contemporary management issues and applications. Topics include the scope and approaches of ecological enquiry; abiotic and biotic factors determining distributions; population growth and regulation; species interactions; patterns and maintenance of biodiversity; food web analysis; disturbance and succession; and production ecology and nutrient cycling. Particular emphasis is placed on integrating ecological processes across spatial and temporal scales. Practical work will be completed via a field excursion together with in-laboratory practical sessions.",

The unit begins by studying the sources of prosperity via economic growth in the modern era, with particular reference to the Great Divergence in incomes that started during the 1800s. Second, the unit asks why some economic systems have prospered, whilst others have declined by turning its attention to disparate experiences of world-wide economic growth such as poverty and starvation. Finally we study the effects and prospects for future economic development in the context of environmental sustainability and climate change.",
