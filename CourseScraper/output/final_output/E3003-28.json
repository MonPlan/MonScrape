A computational approach is employed to teach the concepts of statistics, and decision making in the presence of uncertainty.  An important aspect will be to develop skills for compiling data from multiple sources to support better decisions and models. Topics covered will include simulation and randomisation methods, decision and credibility theory, data wrangling and visualisation, methods for time series, Bayesian analysis and models for risk and loss distributions.",

It is envisaged that the project may involve design of mechanical components, sensing, actuation and computing elements, a simulated model or similar.  Before work is started on the project a safety induction and/or risk assessment process will be completed. The student will also complete a research proposal or requirements analysis to ensure that the scope and expected outcomes of the project are agreed between student and supervisor.
