Consideration is given to the biological, psychological, developmental, sociocultural and environmental factors that may contribute to the development of addiction. It will provide in-depth consideration of theories of addiction and resulting models, and will offer critical discourse around the use of the term. Similarly, measurement issues for addiction and dependence will be reviewed and critically analysed including the policy and media uses of 'addiction' and related terms. The topics addressed will also include aetiological issues and developmental issues around substance use and the onset of problems. The concluding topic will be around the experiential effects of substance use and the model of 'drug, set and setting' with implications for the development of a biopsychosocial model. The assessments are designed to assess the student's ability to summarise and critically review the evidence and underlying conceptual models of addiction and the extension of the term beyond substance use to include process addictions such as gambling. The unit will also examine the issue of stigma and its relationship to language and professional descriptions of addictive behaviours.

These conditions are mainly diagnosed and managed in this setting. As previous reports in the literature have expressed concern about the level of under-diagnosis and the 'low treated prevalence' of patients with mental disorders (which included depression and anxiety), the aim of this unit is to enable students to increase their skills assessing, identifying and managing patients with mental ill-health - specifically depressive and anxiety disorders.The acquisition of skills and confidence that students are expected to develop in this unit will then hopefully make a difference to clinical practice and patients, translating into better patient outcomes, both in terms of the quality of care provided and the number of affected patients that are provided with assistance."

MCM5507,Child health,"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences",[],6,0.125,,MFM1007.,3," Primary care involves providing health care to patients across a variety of age groups. It is important to understand, however, that child health issues differ from the health issues of adults. The child health unit will focus on children aged 0-14 years. Health professionals working with children in this age group require knowledge and skills which are different to those skills utilised when managing adults. The child health unit recognises this need and aims to build on the existing knowledge of health professionals who work with children in the primary health care setting. It addresses aspects of child health commonly encountered in primary care and includes the initial management of common paediatric emergencies and developmental assessments. The child health unit focuses on a systematic and evidence-based approach to child health issues, comprehensive management plans that include carers of children and various health professionals, and the assessment and management of children in the context of their psychosocial and physical environment.The child health unit has been designed for general practitioners, family medicine specialists, nurses and allied health professionals who work with children in the primary health care setting. The child health unit runs over 12 sessions. It is run as an interactive case-based and clinically-focussed unit to ensure relevance to all students of varying health professional backgrounds and geographical location.

Midwifery practice in Australia and overseas is increasingly faced with women requiring technological solutions to complex clinical situations. Obstetrics as a profession is shrinking in numbers, and the impact of a lack of professional indemnity insurance has forced the reordering of maternity services. Government policies and reports advocate for an increased role for midwifery in the provision of maternity services at all levels of risk. In many countries around the world midwifery is at the forefront of a range of complexity of maternity care, but the preparation of midwives for complex practice is ad hoc and poorly realised.This Unit aims to prepare midwives with the knowledge for skills development in complex clinical situations. The unit is structured to allow flexibility and individualisation of the content to better meet the needs of individual practitioners and their practice settings. Theoretical knowledge will include pathophysiology, technology, evidence and practice issues related to skills clusters. These clusters include: Prenatal, Perinatal, Postnatal and High Risk.Opportunities will be given for students to participate in an inter-professional workshop with medical students to acquire some complex clinical skills. Students will understand the requirement and processes necessary for evidence based practice and will gain skills for its implementation in an environment that might be resistant.

NUR2204,Working with families across the lifespan,"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences",[],6,0.125,,,1,"This unit introduces the concept of working with families from a strengths-based framework. The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels.
