Rather, international public order is best understood as the practical regulation of a global society of state and sub-state actors, subordinate to the trans-national rule of law. International law, therefore, is inseparable from the wider issues of global governance, the mechanisms, institutions and principles that enable the global society to operate as an integrated political and legal system.Taking this unit, students will not only acquire a sophisticated understanding of the concepts of international public order and the trans-national rule of law, but also how the integrity of the international system is inseparable from the practical operation of global governance. Understanding will be achieved through the detailed examination of a particular area of concern within international public order and how formal legal resolutions of disputes must necessarily be framed within terms of global governance and the trans-national rule of law.The topics to be studied include: the international legal process (the concept and sources of international law); international law as the judicial basis of global governance; and practical problems in international law and world order (conflict prevention; socio-political justice; international economic law; and international environmental law)."

LAW4247,Current issues in statutory interpretation,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW1101 and LAW1104 (or equivalent from another institution),,3," The first half of the unit will consist of an in-depth consideration of the main theories of statutory interpretation:  intentionalism, textualism and purposivism.  With regard to intentionalism, the focus will not only be on the standard arguments for and against intentionalism, but also on the deeper theoretical commitments of intentionalism.  For example, intentionalism presupposes that there is a defensible notion of legislative intent.  Students will consider not only classic (aggregative) theories of legislative intent, and the criticisms of those theories, but also contemporary (largely non-aggregative) theories.  Students will also consider the current scepticism among judges on the High Court of Australia towards the concept of legislative intent.  Similarly, with regard to textualism, consideration will be given not only to the standard arguments for and against textualism, but also to different versions of textualism based on different accounts of the meaning of a legal text.  Consideration will also be given to Andrei Marmor's recent argument that, while textualism provides an accurate account of the meaning of statutory texts, few appellate court cases involving statutory interpretation turn on a correct understanding of the meaning of the relevant statutory text.The second half of the unit will turn from theory to practice, with an in-depth consideration of the High Court of Australia's current approach to statutory interpretation and some criticisms of that approach.  Students will consider the role that constitutional principles governing the distinction between judicial and legislative power affect the way in which judges interpret statutes, the general approach that judges take to statutory interpretation and the account of the linguistic content of statutes implicitly accepted by the High Court.  Consideration will also be given to the role that the principle of legality plays in the interpretation of statutes, and cases where the legal effect of a statute may differ from its linguistic content (where, for example, that linguistic content is ambiguous or where there is a need for equitable interpretation).  Critical attention will focus on the High Court's understanding of the difference between legislative and judicial power, and its understanding of the relationship between the linguistic content of a statute and the legal effect of that statute."

The subject will critically analyse the key groups often categorised as ecoterrorist including Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, the Animal Liberation Front and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.  It will focus on their founders, historical development, key philosophical beliefs and practices.  Students will be encouraged to draw on theoretical debates to identify the ways in which modern ecoterrorism has tested and/or reinforced the traditional assumptions, ideologies, arguments and institutions of international environmental law and policy.Students will be challenged to develop and refine their ability to analyse critically the different ways in which environmental problems and risks are perceived, framed and managed by differently situated actors within an ecoterrorist context.  The subject  cover the international and domestic legal responses to ecoterrorism.

Next, the Unit explores the extent to which sport's '""specificity"" (its unique social and cultural standing and need for ""competitive balance"") has seen legislatures and courts modify the application to it of traditional legal concepts. Areas to be examined include the application of criminal law to on-field violence; tort and OHS law to sports related injuries; contract and employment law to sports persons' employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements; competition, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination law to the rules and practices by which sporting competitions are organised and conducted; and privacy, intellectual property, discrimination and other laws to protect a sports person's name, image, likeness and other attributes of their identity or person. The Unit then explores the development of unique legal rules and institutions tailored to sports persons and sporting activities, and the extent to which they are amenable to state regulatory and judicial systems.

LAW4515,International criminology,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," Part I, 'Understanding Criminology', presents an overview of criminology - now made more exciting via integrated coverage of terrorism and related crimes - and describes the vast horizon of this science.  It explains what crime is and techniques for measuring the amount and characteristics of crime and criminals.  It also traces the history of criminological thought through the era that witnessed the formation of the major schools of criminology, classicism and positivism (eighteenth and nineteenth centuries).Part II, 'Explanations of Crime and Criminal Behaviour', includes explanations of crime and criminal behaviour on the basis of the various theories developed in the twentieth century.  Among the subjects covered are theories that offer biological, psychological, sociological, socio-political, and integrated explanations.  Coverage of research by radical, socialist, and feminist criminologists has been updated.  Theories that discuss why offenders choose to commit one offence rather than another at a given time and place are also covered in this part.Part III, 'Types of Crime', covers the various types of crimes from a legal and sociological perspective.  The familiar street crimes, such as homicide and robbery, are assessed, as are other criminal activities such as white-collar and corporate crime, which are so much in the spotlight these days, as well as other high-tech crimes that have been highlighted by researchers only in recent years."
LAW4516,Comparative perspectives on crime and punishment,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125, For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) course in 2015 or later:LAW1111; LAW1114; LAW1112; LAW1113; LAW2101; LAW2102; LAW2112; LAW2111For students who commenced their LLB course prior to 2015: LAW1100 OR LAW1101 and LAW1102 or LAW1104 AND LAW3300 OR LAW3301 AND LAW3302,,3,"All societies grapple with ensuring compliance with criminal laws, establishing appropriate forms of punishment, and implementing those punishments in acceptable and effective ways. This unit focuses on theories, institutions and processes relating to the legal system's response to breaches of the criminal law, in a range of comparative jurisdictions. Students will examine theories of punishment, approaches to and options for sentencing including imprisonment, and the role of therapeutic jurisprudence and restorative justice. Students will also examine the uses of imprisonment in a range of jurisdictions."
LAW4522,Remedies,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW2102 and LAW2202,,3,"The unit in Remedies will consider the remedial goals of the common law, equity and some important statutes, as well as examine the legal rules and principles which give effect to these goals.The focus will be on damages and coercive remedies. The course will begin by studying the principles underlying compensation before moving to restitution, punishment and coercion. While it will not be possible to look at every general law remedy, the major topics concerning the assessment of damages in tort and contract, misleading or deceptive conduct and for breach of equitable obligations will be studied.Among the questions to be considered are: With compensatory damages being the primary remedy for many torts and for breach of contract, what role is there for punishment and gain-based damages in our law of civil obligations and what remedies give effect to these goals? Why are the compensation rules for tort different from those for contract? How are they different? How do the doctrine of mitigation and other limiting factors affect compensation in common law? In what ways does the assessment of damages for misleading or deceptive conduct differ from damages in tort and contract? Is compensation assessed differently where there is a breach of an equitable obligation? Should it be? When are injunctions and specific performance available, and what factors affect their availability?"

But it would include many if not all of the following:The Judiciary as a branch of government. This will entail an exploration of the concept of judicial independence and its interrelationship with the doctrine of separation of powers. It will focus on the standards for judicial independence as prescribed by international instruments. The relationship with other branches of government will be analysed.Appointment of Judges and Conditions of Service This topic will examine on a comparative basis judicial appointment processes and the criteria for judicial appointment.

LAW4528,Comparative consumer bankruptcy,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"The 'democratization of credit' refers to the recent expansion in access to credit by households in the lower ranges of the distribution of income. A major policy question raised by the democratization of credit is how to adapt consumer bankruptcy law and parallel out-of-court measures to the increased incidence of over indebtedness. As the recent sub prime crisis highlights, common law systems have generally taken a laissez-faire approach and used the bankruptcy system as the primary legal remedy when debtors cannot repay their loans. This unit will deal with the approaches taken in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe and North America, to address the policy questions raised by the democratization of credit in recent years. Among the subjects considered are: out of court and formal bankruptcy procedures, consensual negotiation, creditor responsibility and the historical trajectory of regulatory approaches to over indebtedness."
LAW4531,Product liability law from a comparative perspective,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW2101 Contract A and LAW2102 Contract B and LAW2201 Torts A and LAW2202 Torts B or an equivalent Introductory course in tort law and contract law at another university.,,3," Product Liability refers to civil liability for injuries caused by defective products. This class will focus mainly on two systems of addressing injuries from defective products the American law system and the European Union system.Product liability occupies a central role in American law, as the number of new products used by consumers has increased exponentially. With this proliferation of new consumer products has come an increase in injuries. Products liability is a major way America attempts to deter firms from manufacturing unsafe products, and to compensate those that suffer injury from those products.The first part of the course will examine the American product liability system, focusing on the key sources of law underlying that system--common law principles of negligence, strict liability and deceit, contract and warranty principles, and statutory principles found in the Uniform Commercial Code. Using these sources of law, the course will explore the main theories of manufacturer liability, the concept of product defect, and defences available to the manufacturer under American law.The second part of the course will explore the same issues from the EU perspective. The European Community adopted its first Product Liability Directive in 1985, and its version of strict products liability has since been adopted in some version in many parts of the world. The EU approach differs in many important ways from the American approach. For example, the EU directive focuses on a test for defect the consumer expectation test that has been abandoned or given less significance in most American jurisdictions. The two systems like wise differ in their respective approaches to proof, remedies, defences, and defining a proper defendant. Moreover, unlike the American system, where product liability dominates the system of accident compensation, in most European countries, product liability plays a more modest role, and acts more as a supplement to the social compensation systems available in those countries.Why have the two systems evolved in such different ways? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches? Those are the core issues that the course will address."
LAW4532,Climate change and international law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"Climate change has been described as the defining legal and policy challenge of the 21st century. This unit provides an introduction to the international legal response to this challenge. It examines critically the emergence of climate change as a public policy problem, the relationship between climate science and climate policy, and the negotiation, content and implementation of international legal instruments related to climate change. It will not consider national, sub national or non-governmental approaches to climate change. Topics to be addressed include: the causes and impacts of, and trends in, global climate change; the problem of scientific uncertainty and its implications for international climate change law; the main options for and obstacles to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, and the relationship between mitigation and adaptation; the international politics of climate change, including the differing positions, interests and priorities of developed and developing states and the special challenges facing particularly vulnerable states and communities; the negotiation, content and implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, including Joint Implementation, the Clean Development Mechanism, international emissions trading, financial assistance and technology transfer; key issues and developments in the negotiation and implementation of a post-Kyoto international climate change agreement; the role and meaning of the concepts of state sovereignty, common concern of humankind, sustainable development, common but differentiated responsibilities, intra- and inter-generational equity, the precautionary principle, and climate justice in the international climate change legal regime; key issues, options, proposals and rules surrounding the incorporation of land use and forestry into the international climate change regime, including Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD); compliance, enforcement and dispute settlement in the international climate change regime; interactions between the international climate change regime and international regimes related to ozone depletion, biodiversity, law of the sea, human rights, and international trade; and options and prospects for a transition to a carbon-free or low-carbon future."

It will outline the broad features of the Australian tax system and compare and contrast these features with the broad features of the Malaysian and Singaporean tax systems. Aspects of certain other countries tax regimes will also be briefly considered. Similarities and differences between the various regimes will be highlighted, discussed and analysed. The unit will focus on income tax and goods and services tax. It will use the Australian tax system as the basis for further comparative discussion. Special attention will be devoted to discussing Australia's international tax rules and its international tax treaties with Singapore and/or Malaysia. Broad policy issues relating to the design of tax systems and international tax rules will also be considered."
LAW4534,Law and biology,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," Rules aim to create order in our society. They provide structure so people know how to behave and what to expect from others. Rules are devised by people. Biologically, people are creatures that live in groups and need groups. Rules are needed to maintain group stability. Law, therefore, is in essence a biological phenomenon that can, and indeed should, be studied in the light of biological theories. In addition, because modern biology cannot be comprehended without evolutionary processes, evolutionary biology is one of the perspectives that can increase our understanding of the principles of law. To be sure, we should be careful in applying biological mechanisms to legal subjects, yet we may more fully grasp the nature of law by bringing the two disciplines together.It is currently also difficult to use evolutionary biology to determine which legal incentives should be used to regulate behaviour, not least because we do not exactly know to what end we should regulate behaviour. However, these caveats do not imply that law cannot be seen as a kind of extended phenotype that can be studied by biologists.  With the right genes, an organism can build a shelter, thereby improving not only its survival chances but also the replication chances of its genes. It is reasonable to assume that people have the right genes to build a law system that maximises their survival chances.However, will this confuse the is with the ought? In philosophy, it is taboo to derive norms from facts. In the context of law and biology, however, this seems odd as connecting these disciplines is very much about linking the ought and the is. Where biology can give us credible foundations for law, there necessarily has to be a connection between is and ought. Moreover, we should ask ourselves whether there even is a substantial difference between the two notions. Could we not regard the ought as a particular type of is?From this point of view, morals and rules are a product of our brain, as are all interpretations of facts. The brain in its turn is also a product of genes and environment.When law is studied from a biological perspective, then questions should be asked about the rationality of law. How can a judge take a strictly rational decision when our thinking is closely linked with emotion and feelings? Can the gap between legal professionals and ordinary citizens be partly explained because jurists do not ask themselves whether lawfulness includes a sense of justice?In this course we will study biological and psychological backgrounds of the law. This may not always be easy, because several of our certainties may prove to be illusory or ill-founded. Asking questions about the biological foundations of law involves questioning our own identity. In that sense, science is ruthless;  dogmas must and will be questioned.Can biology and psychology give all the answers? Certainly not. Nevertheless, it is important to think implications over. As Mill said: Maybe the opinion is true, or maybe is contains a portion of truth an even there is no truth in it at all, then it still sharpens our own conviction.In this course we will explore some biological and psychological facts and we will ask ourselves questions like: Can biology usefully contribute to moral argument? Can it contribute to an understanding of the proper role and functioning of legal norms?The lecturer published articles in which he states that the ought can be derived from the biological is. Nevertheless, he explicitly challenges his students to falsify this statement. In this way students can explore the issues and form their own views."
LAW4535,International and comparative trade mark law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125, For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) course in 2015 or later:LAW1111; LAW1114; LAW1112; LAW1113; LAW2101; LAW2102; LAW2112; LAW2111,,3,"This unit will provide an overview of the obligations under international law to provide protection to trade marks and a comparison of selected, key aspects of trade mark protection in Australia, the United States and the EU. Consequently, in relation to international law, it will examine the trade mark aspects of the TRIPS agreement (including consideration of geographical indications) and the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of ICANN relating to domain names. To a lesser extent, deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol relating to multiple filings of trade mark applications. Selected, key aspects of comparison will include issues such as jurisdiction specific approaches to ownership, the requirements for registrability of trade marks such as shape trade marks and the different approaches to infringement, including dilution of trade marks and parallel importing. Other topics may include the registration and control of domain names. It is likely that, in light of Australian legislation and WTO challenges, the unit will also critically examine the arguments of the tobacco industry that international trade mark obligations prevent the implementation of plain packaging of cigarettes."
LAW4536,International and comparative family law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," This course begins with comparative approaches to a range of legal traditions in which family law is idiosyncratically situated. Topical issues touching on how domestic law interacts with legal diversity in family law will be canvassed. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interactions between religiously-governed family law and secular state law.From the comparative law perspective, the course will progress to a consideration of the ways in which Immigration and Refugee Law interacts with domestic family law and family law policy.The seminar will then progress to an examination of the traditional common law conflict of law principles that touch on family law matters, including jurisdiction and recognition and international enforcement of foreign family law orders. Consideration will then be given to the modification of the common law regime by treaty and legislation, including the various Hague Conventions that apply to family law issues. Further attention will be given to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as other human rights treaties. Each regime will be considered in the context of its impact upon domestic legal issues.The six main area of family law will be examined through the lenses of comparative and international law, including marriage, divorce, matrimonial property, adoption, custody, and support."
LAW4537,"Public policy, regulation and the law",Faculty of Law,"[[['Clayton'], ['Second semester 2017 (Day)']]]",6,0.125, For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) course in 2015 or later:LAW1111; LAW1114; LAW1112; LAW1113; LAW2101; LAW2102; LAW2112; LAW2111For students who commenced their LLB course prior to 2015:LAW1100 OR LAW1101 and LAW1102 or LAW1104,None,3,"This Unit explores the interrelationship between public policy, regulation and the law.  The Unit begins by introducing students to the policy cycle - the process by which issues (or problems) are identified and prioritised for action by government, and the action to be taken to address the issue (solve the problem) is agreed. In doing so, the Unit will expose students to some of the challenges facing governments and regulators when deciding whether and how to address a particular issue. The Unit also will introduce students to the breadth of tools available to governments to achieve their policy ends. In doing so, the Unit will explore how the concept of 'regulation' has expanded beyond the traditional legal concept of regulation as rules promulgated by a sovereign state, to include all the tools used by governments and other actors to alter or control the behaviour of people and other entities. The Unit will then explore some the theories, concepts and constructs that explain regulatory practice in a modern liberal capitalist society, before moving on to consider what may constitute 'good' regulation and regulatory practice. Finally, the Unit will explore how the law intersects with, supports and shapes public policy and the regulatory endeavour. Rather than focus on one substantive area of regulation, several case studies will be used to illustrate and highlight the general themes of the Unit. Moreover, the Unit will include aspects of politics, economics, public administration and public policy in its consideration of the issues, further developing students' skills in understanding and applying the law in its societal context."
LAW4538,"Lawyers, literature and cinema",Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125, LAW1101LAW1104,None,3," The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community.Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law."
LAW4539,Modern constitutionalism: A comparative perspective,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," In the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that the age of parliamentary democracy had passed and that the concept of constitutional democracy had swept the world. Yet, closer study reveals that the picture is not uniform. First, substantively different versions of the constitutional model may be identified. Second, it is already possible to see the first signs of a shift to a stage of synthesis in which a new constitutional model is being generated which integrates the principle of the supremacy of the legislature with that of the supremacy of the judiciary.This course will concentrate on presenting various constitutional models and examining their advantages and disadvantages. The course will be divided into three parts. In the first part we shall describe the 'traditional constitutional model' and its underlying rationale. In addition, we shall distinguish between various versions of this model and illustrate them by describing and comparing the constitutional mechanism in a number of countries (United States, Germany, France and Italy). In the second part, we shall examine several arguments against the traditional constitutional model and various proposals made to resolve those argument. In the third part, we shall describe the 'synthesized model', explain its rationale and illustrate it by describing the constitutional mechanism in a number of countries which have apparently adopted it (Canada, New Zealand and Great Britain)."

LAW4642,Issues in medical ethics and law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," This unit will cover a selected number of issues in medical law and ethics. Topics will include general issues that revolve around notions of autonomy, competency and compulsion as well as a number of contemporary bioethics issues such as organ transplantation, abortion and medical research.In discussing these issues, students will be encouraged to think about the differences as well as the interplay between legal rules and ethical guidelines. The discussions will also include a consideration of the different approaches taken by different countries and students will be invited to think critically about the responses of different jurisdictions."
LAW4643,Corporate social responsibility,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This Unit will introduce students to the idea, and foundation, of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a component of corporate governance.  Students will then be exposed to various facets of the three distinct but interrelated challenges to CSR.  First, why should corporations have social responsibilities towards their stakeholders?  Second, what is the scope, nature and extent of these responsibilities?  Third, how could corporations be made accountable for violating their social responsibilities in areas such as human rights, labour rights and the environment?Issues such as the following will be explored: meaning and historical evolution of the notion of CSR - comparing CSR with concepts such as corporate accountability, corporate citizenship, triple bottom line, corporate philanthropy,   and sustainable business; CSR and corporate governance - CSR's intrusion into company law; changing interface of states, corporations, law, and human rights against the backdrop of globalisation - privatisation of states and human rights; drivers of CSR, e.g., a risk management tool, ethical investing and consumerism, business case for CSR; ethical, social, legal and economic justifications for CSR; scope, nature and extent of social responsibilities - complicity of corporations with states in human rights abuses, responsibilities of corporations operating in conflict zones or repressive regimes, handling CSR issues within supply chains and in global operations; review of existing CSR initiatives: private v. public, voluntary v. obligatory, national v. international - the ""protect, respect and remedy"" framework proposed by Professor John Ruggie, UN Secretary General's Special Representative on Business and Human Rights; and CSR litigation (e.g., under common law and the US Alien Tort Claims Act) and the challenges thereof - the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and the allocation of liability within a corporate group."

LAW4646,Sexuality and the law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,None,None,3,"This unit will examine various sources of international law that potentially apply to sexuality-based claims. The approach of individual states, both from a domestic law perspective and in interpreting international obligations, will also be considered. We will examine international treaties and case law from various international as well as domestic courts.  Consideration will be given to policy objectives and competing cultural and political arguments. Students will work in groups and participate in exercises where they simulate the roles played by various constituencies, including judges, state actors, lawyers, and individuals claiming discriminatory treatment."
LAW4647,Great books of the common law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,None,None,3,"This unit begins with a detailed discussion of several well-known cases from the common law of Contract. The goal is to notice the gaps between the rules and the ultimate decisions. The course continues with a discussion of Max Weber's classical statement of how legal questions are decided in the civil law and his suggestion that adjudication in the common law is irrational. The unit then attempts to respond to Weber's challenge by focusing on the classical discussion of this question by some of the great theorists of the common law, together with contemporary writers who contribute to the same discussion. Students will read and discuss chapters by several writers, including Blackstone, Holmes, Maitland, Cardozo, Llewellyn, Hart and Sachs, Gilmore, Posner, Unger, Frug, Williams, and Fisher. Emphasis will be on discussion both the discussion among the theorists themselves and our own discussion with the competing traditions that we discover in the reading."
LAW4648,Ethics and criminal justice,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,None,None,3,"This unit introduces the key concepts in the administration of criminal justice and the major ethical systems. It examines issues relevant to the administration of criminal justice by identifying the ethical dilemmas that might arise for professionals in the criminal justice system. Topics will include ethics and police, ethics and lawyers, ethics in corrections and the ethics of criminal justice policy making. In discussing ethical dilemmas at the various stages of the administration of criminal justice, students will be encouraged and challenged to think about the differences and interplay between the procedural rules, institutional practices and ethical guidelines. The impact and implications of the issues are considered and their possible resolutions explored. The different approaches taken by different countries in tackling the said issues will be examined by students, who will be invited to think critically about how ethics can facilitate in the search for the appropriate resolution for the said issues."
LAW4649,Mediation and law: From problem solving to narrative building,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,None,None,3,"The unit explores four models which exist within the field of mediation, and examines their connection with various jurisprudential approaches. Mediation is an alternative method to litigation, in which a third party facilitates negotiation between at least two other parties. Mediation is the paradigmatic alternative to adjudication and its basic principles are unique and different from those of the adversarial model. The course examines the notion of mediation by referring to four conceptual frameworks to understand it: Traditional communal; Pragmatic problem solving; Humanistic Transformative and Narrative Cultural. Each model of mediation will be studied both in practice and theory, and its relation to jurisprudential streams of thought will be examined. Theories such as legal feminism, legal pluralism, multiculturalism and postmodernism will be studied as possible foundations for the various models, and their application will be examined critically through the use of case studies, films and simulations. The overall sequence of the course will show the transformation of mediation from a pragmatic efficient alternative to litigation to a public narrative based method for the resolution of public dispute."

It has also challenged the capacities of national governments to regulate economic activity within their domestic domains.The post-World War II trading rules (including GATT), along with the lower cost of international transport and the advent of the internet have facilitated the rapid growth of global economic activity, and the growth of international corporate behemoths. This has brought about substantial economic benefits to many, and assisted with lifting millions of people out of poverty. However, this has come at the expense of lowered competition through the growth of global monopolists (or near monopolists), the exploitation of labour and the environment, and increased tax and regulatory evasion, as national governments struggle to regulate cross-border activities. These trends are placing strains on domestic consensus about the benefits of economic globalisation, which is evident in the rise of nationalistic movements in various countries, including those in developed countries.This unit engages students in critical discussion and evaluations about the nature and form of these developments, the key global arrangements and institutions involved, the costs and benefits of these developments, and ways in which reforms could be undertaken.Students will actively engage in analysis and debate about: global trading arrangements and institutions (GATT, WTO and free trade agreements); global financing arrangements and institutions (IMF, Bank of International Settlements, and the resolution of international investment disputes settlements - the ICSID); the possibilities for global regulation of the exploitation of labour and the environment and access to medicines; and global policy making institutions and organisations, including the G20, OECD, UNCTAD, UNCITRAL, Davos and NGOs."

A patent provides the patentee with a critical and powerful tool for commercial exploitation of new inventions in all fields of technology. Invention is necessarily exciting and dynamic and leads to cutting edge innovation in such areas as biotechnology, nanotechnology, medical and therapeutic devices and treatments, business methods and systems and internet related inventions. The grant of patent monopoly rights provides the owner with a powerful tool that directly impacts on competition. A patent can have significant implications for users and the public in general who seek access to new technology on reasonable terms.An essential feature of the patent system is the public disclosure of the invention in return for the patent monopoly but the use of that information is restrained by the scope of the patentee's exclusive rights.

LAW5427,Freedom of speech: Law theory and policy,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," This subject is divided into three main parts. In the first part, an examination will be made of what are said to be the philosophical underpinnings of the notion of freedom of speech. Those underpinnings will be critically assessed, and their limitations, with regard to particular forms of speech, analysed. In this part of the course consideration will also be given to what we should appropriately regard as constituting ""speech"" in the context of freedom of speech - for instance, should the wearing of religious adornments count as ""speech"" for the purposes of freedom of speech? Consideration will be given, too, to what is appropriately understood by ""freedom"" in the context of freedom of speech and what such freedom requires - for example, in order for there to be ""freedom of speech"" in the requisite sense, is it necessary that there be laws positively enabling speech? Or is it sufficient simply that there be no laws prohibiting or limiting speech?In the second part of the course, an examination will first of all be made of Australia's obligations, pursuant to international law, with regard to the provision of freedom of speech. Then, consideration will be given to the protections actually afforded to freedom of speech both in Australia and overseas. In an Australian context, in-depth consideration will be given to the implied freedom of political communication contained in the Australian Constitution and to the so-called principle of ""legality"", used in statutory interpretation to limit the circumstances in which statutory power can infringe upon fundamental rights (including freedom of speech). Consideration will also be given to the relevant provisions of the Victorian Charter.In an overseas context, students will be provided with an overview of the protection afforded to freedom of speech in the United States, Canada and the European Community. Comparisons will be drawn with the protection afforded in Australia.In the third part of the course - which will occupy about half of the course - in-depth consideration will be given to various Australian legal regimes that prohibit, restrict or otherwise regulate certain kinds of speech (and which, therefore, restrict or regulate freedom of speech). These regimes will be drawn from a pool including (but not necessarily limited to) regimes that prohibit, restrict or regulate racial or religious vilification; obscenity and pornography; incitement to illegal conduct; defamation; campaign finance and commercial speech.In respect of each regime that is considered, critical analysis will be undertaken as to whether the limitations on freedom of speech imposed by the regime are justified, by reference both to the underlying principles in support of freedom of speech generally, and to the specific objectives that are sought to be achieved by the regime in question."

It will examine the particular problems of extending existing law to accommodate the digital environment and review proposals for reform. The topics covered include copyright, domain names, trade marks, passing off and patents. Given the global nature of the internet, these issues will be looked at from the domestic and international perspectives."
LAW5448,Copyright X: Monash,Faculty of Law,"[[[], ['Trimester 1 2017 (On-campus block of classes)']]]",6,0.125,,,3,"US and International Copyright Law and Theory is based on materials developed by William Fisher for CopyrightX at Harvard Law School. Online lectures are recorded by Professor Fisher, and weekly seminars are conducted at Monash. Students in this course will have an opportunity to participate in online discussions of copyright-related issues.  Students who successfully complete the unit will also be eligible to receive a certificate of completion from Harvard.  The unit explores US copyright law and the ongoing debates about how the law should be reformed. The unit will cover: theory - the arguments, drawn primarily from economics, political theory, and philosophy, concerning why and how the law should regulate uses of expressive materials; doctrine - the rules currently in force concerning uses of expressive materials and the ways in which those rules are typically interpreted and applied; and practice - how those rules affect various fields of art, industry, and culture, including literature, music, film, photography, journalism, software design, architecture, fashion, comedy and games."
LAW5449,Advanced administrative law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW5014,,3," Administrative law determines what governments can and cannot do.  It is a dynamic and rapidly changing area of law and practice. This unit will enable students to understand key issues affecting contemporary administrative law, how and why the law is changing, and what those changes might bring.The unit will cover three key contemporary questions in administrative law.  The first is whether and how public law does and should take account of commercial issues.  This part of the course will ask whether administrative law remedies such as judicial review should apply to private sector bodies that perform ""quasi-public"" functions.  It will also consider whether judicial review and other administrative law remedies should apply, or be modified, to government decisions that could be regulated by other commercial law principles. Should judicial review apply to government tendering decisions?  Are notions of ""commercial in confidence"" a sound reason to withhold details about government contracts from the public?  Should companies have standing in administrative law to challenge government decisions which benefit competing companies?The second key issue the course will consider is whether the courts are always the best forum to challenge government decisions.  Public law remedies traditionally involve one party who challenges a single decision, but many decisions are ""polycentric"" because they raise many issues and affect many people.  This part of course will examine those ""polycentric decisions"", such as planning and revenue decisions, and consider why some decisions are less suited for review by courts and tribunals than are other decisions that are not polycentric (or, at least not polycentric to such an extent).  It will also compare the position in Australia with that in England where the courts have developed legal principles to regulate public consultation.The third issue the course will consider concerns national security - how, when and why issues of national security can affect administrative law review?  This problem has emerged as governments in Australia and other common law jurisdictions have sought to limit the rights of people to challenge decisions, or receive information, in cases involving national security.  This part of the course will examine those decisions in Australia where normal rights of review by the courts or tribunals are limited for reasons of national security.  This part of the course will also consider when and how the Australian Constitution might require a minimum level of fairness in such cases."
LAW5450,Principles of succession law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW5006,,3," Around 30-40,000 people die each year in Victoria. The management and distribution of their property is determined by principles of succession law.  Succession law governs how the property of a deceased is distributed, who can manage a deceased estate and how distributions may be challenged distribution. This unit will enable students to understand the key issues affecting succession law, the directions that people can incorporate into a will and the professional obligations lawyers face in succession law.The unit covers four key elements of succession law. The first is intestacy (when a person dies without a valid will) and will making. This part of the course examines the presumptive distribution of assets in intestacy and the novel Victorian approach. It also examines the execution requirements for will making and the process to grant probate to wills and codicils that do not meet those requirements.The second key issue of the course is the doctrines affecting testamentary gifts. What can and cannot be done through the gift clauses? This part of the course examines the nature and  limits of ""testamentary freedom"" (the ability of people to dispose of their estate as they wish).A key such limit is ""family provision"", under which close relative and partners of a deceased person can challenge the distribution of an estate.The third part of the course examines managing and distributing deceased estates.  This includes the standards for those managing an estate, control of funeral and burial arrangements and when and how can beneficiaries challenge or remove a personal representative.The final part of the course examines professional obligations of lawyers.  Succession law generates a high level of professional complaints against lawyers.  The course will examine the special rules governing the conduct of lawyers, particularly when they act the personal representative of an estate."

Family law and personal relations often also trigger transnational disputes. While these may be referred to in passing, they are not part of the core of this course. The course specifically addresses not just the reality of transnational litigation. It also emphasizes the potential for employing conflict of laws in procuring jurisdiction and applicable law in the best interest of the parties.  The general introductory part of the unit will provide student with a ""bird's eye view"" of transnational litigation, covering issues such as the fundamental concept, nature, development, sources and key processes of private international law, the standard 'connecting factors', characterization, renvoi and the 'incidental' issue.  Forum shopping and forum non conveniens will also be compared across civil and common law jurisdictions.  A more detailed comparative examination of key transnational legal issues will following, including jurisdiction in 'civil and commercial' matters, questions on applicable law (Contract and Torts), international insolvency, international succession (inheritance), and recognition and enforcement of judgements. The final part of the unit will examine current issues, such as corporate social responsibility and conflicts."
LAW5454,Climate governance and citizen justice,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This unit will provide a state of the art, up to date overview of the links between climate change and citizen justice. It will discuss the phenomena of climate displacement, providing an understanding of the dynamics of climate displacement, the countries which are now and in the future most heavily affected and the legal and policy measures, including migration, that will be required to ensure that all climate-displaced persons are afforded rights-based and viable solutions to their displacement. By approaching these vexing issues in this manner, the course will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the legal issues involved, how the human rights of climate-affected persons can be invoked and where work is underway today to protect the rights of those affected, with an emphasis on Bangladesh, Fiji, Kiribati, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu."
LAW5455,Chinese law and innovation policies,Faculty of Law,"[[[], ['Trimester 1 2017 (On-campus block of classes)']]]",6,0.125,,,3," This unit aims to equip future cross-cultural lawyers and regional policy-makers with the ability to understand the relationship between business law and issues of civil society. The unit will focus will be on high profile topics, namely China's internet laws, innovation policies and environmental policy considerations.Students must create a collaborative research project (a mock business venture or social enterprise) that evaluates whether Chinese laws and regulations are effective, responsive and coherent. Contentious and highly topical issues such as China's complex internet laws and innovation policies will be considered in depth.Classes will focus on preparedness for practice in an international legal environment, including class exercises and interactive seminars.Legal systems reflect the cultures and societies in which they operate. Cross-cultural thinking is therefore crucial for foreign lawyers to advise effectively on transnational deals and for policy-makers to create strategic international and regional policy solutions.Students will gain an overview of the Chinese legal system while focusing on the most important economic issues facing China and the world.This unit provides a targeted look at China's legal system, its complexity and its dynamic nature, and provides the tools to stay abreast of key changes.This unit complements LAW5437 China's legal system and they may be taken either as single units or together (in any order)."
LAW5456,"Science, technology and law",Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"Science, Technology & Law examines the convergence of legal, social and scientific issues raised by innovative science, particularly biotechnology. The subject is intended to allow students to examine at an advanced level significant laws and regulatory systems relevant to the undertaking and commercialisation of science and technology and how the law attempts to keep pace with ongoing scientific developments.

This unit investigates case law, domestic legislation and regulations of the European Union, namely the Brussels I Regulation, the Rome I Regulation and the Rome II Regulation."
LAW5609,Law and liberty,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"The aim of this course is to consider the meaning of political liberty in Europe, US and Australia today. It will examine the theoretical underpinnings of many areas of human rights, such as free speech, privacy and political rights. To do so it will compare different traditions of Western thought that continue to influence our views on liberty. The course is based upon close readings of selected politico-legal philosophers, for example John Stuart Mill's ""On Liberty"", which argues for freedom of speech and action to the extent that this freedom is consistent with not harming others. Liberal and republican views of political freedom are contrasted, along with Kant's analysis that provides the theoretical underpinning of many arguments for human rights. While the course is structured around an examination of primary philosophical readings, the theoretical frameworks will be considered in the context of contemporary legal debates and concepts."
LAW5610,"Varieties of the secular: Law, religion, and social change",Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This seminar will provide both an historical and contemporary comparative look at the ways that legal systems have dealt with religious difference, freedom of religion, and ""the secular"". An important note in contemporary scholarship on the contemporary interaction of law and religion has been that there is not a single ""secular"" but, rather, varieties of secularisms. A close study of the various ways that political power, law, and religion have been configured provides a unique and valuable line of sight into comparative legal traditions, constitutional structure, and legal and political theory. Some of the most interesting contemporary legal and political debates have arisen out of questions about freedom of religion, its limits, and the just relationship between religion and the state."
LAW5611,Comparative issues in patent law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This unit will examine from an international and comparative perspective the most fundamental question in patent law: what subject matter should patent law protect with a twenty year monopoly?

LAW5614,Regulating relationships and families,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," This unit focuses on different types of families and how intra-family relationships are regulated under Australian family law and comparative overseas family law systems. The unit is designed to challenge students about notions of families and relationships. It looks at 'traditional' marriages as well as same sex marriages and de facto relationships in different jurisdictions. It looks at families formed through assisted reproductive technology, adoption and surrogacy. Once legislators intervene, courts need to interpret statutory frameworks in light of cultural values and social science knowledge. Students will examine how culture and social science influence legislation and case law. Students will also examine the notion of 'best interests' of the child and how this is determined in Australia and other jurisdictions.This unit also challenges students to consider what constitutes child abuse and neglect.

The subject will critically analyse the key groups often categorised as ecoterrorist including Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, the Animal Liberation Front and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.  It will focus on their founders, historical development, key philosophical beliefs and practices.  Students will be encouraged to draw on theoretical debates to identify the ways in which modern ecoterrorism has tested and/or reinforced the traditional assumptions, ideologies, arguments and institutions of international environmental law and policy.Students will be challenged to develop and refine their ability to analyse critically the different ways in which environmental problems and risks are perceived, framed and managed by differently situated actors within an ecoterrorist context.  The subject  cover the international and domestic legal responses to ecoterrorism. The subject also contextualises the major legal developments by examining the key state and non-state actors and institutions involved in the negotiation, settlement and enforcement of law relating to ecoterrorist activities.

Broad policy issues relating to the design of tax systems and international tax rules will also be considered."
LAW5618,Comparative cybercrime,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,LAW5353(previously LAW7280),3,"The advent of the internet and the proliferation of ICTs have transformed the way we socialise and do business. However, these technologies may also be used to commit or facilitate the commission of crimes; so-called 'cybercrimes'. The transnational nature of modern communications means that cybercrime is a global problem; with offender and victim potentially located anywhere in the world. Adopting a comparative approach, this unit provides an overview of the challenges of cybercrime, and legal responses to those challenges. Topics to be covered include cybercrime investigations, hacking, identity theft, child exploitation offences, and online harassment. Although drawing primarily upon the experience of common law jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the UK and the US), these responses will be considered in light of the principal international instrument in the area; the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. There will also be discussion of international efforts to achieve harmonisation of cybercrime laws."
LAW5619,European human rights law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This unit will provide an overview of the origin, development and current status of human rights protection in Europe. Its primary focus will be on the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has established the most sophisticated and successful regional system of human rights protection in the world. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, holds to account member states for violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention to over 800 million persons. The second component concentrates on the European Union and how on the basis of a few EU Treaty provisions - now reinforced by the Charter of Fundamental Rights - the Court of justice has fashioned a comprehensive and dynamic system of judicial protection."
LAW5620,Privacy and surveillance in an information age: Comparative law perspectives,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,LAW5343,3,"This unit will examine from a comparative perspective, the legal and social issues relating to the protection of individual privacy against the state, the media, companies and other individuals. It will introduce students to comparative perspectives relating to the protection of privacy against intrusions and unauthorised disclosures, and relating to data privacy.

LAW5621,Mediation and law: From problem solving to narrative building,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," The unit explores four models which exist within the field of mediation, and examines their connection with various jurisprudential approaches. Mediation is an alternative method to litigation, in which a third party facilitates negotiation between at least two other parties. Mediation is the paradigmatic alternative to adjudication and its basic principles are unique and different from those of the adversarial model. The course examines the notion of mediationby referring to four conceptual frameworks to understand it: Traditional communal; Pragmatic problem solving; Humanistic Transformative and Narrative Cultural. Each model of mediation will be studied both in practice and theory, and its relation to jurisprudential streams of thought will be examined. Theories such as legal feminism, legal pluralism, multiculturalism and postmodernismwill be studied as possible foundations for the various models, and their application will be examined critically through the use of case studies, films and simulations. The overall sequence of the course will show the transformation of mediation from a pragmatic efficient alternative to litigation to a public narrative based method for the resolution of public dispute."
LAW5622,Human dignity in comparative perspective,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,The unit will begin with a philosophical overview of the concept of human dignity and then enter into a historical examination of why human dignity has emerged as an important constitutional principle in international law and some jurisdictions. International and national experiences with human dignity as a constitutional and/or human rights principle will be critically examined. Particular attention will be paid to the role of human dignity in the so-called Arab Spring and its aftermath.
LAW5623,Human rights and the European Union,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW7470 or an equivalent introductory unit at another university,LAW7155 or LAW7026,3,"This unit seeks to further understanding of two highly dynamic yet overlapping areas of international law, the legal order of the European Union (EU) on the one hand and Human Rights Law on the other hand. The EU presents itself as a highly developed international organization producing directly applicable law for European citizens and stretching its competences well beyond what most ordinary international organizations have been  endowed with to date. But can it also serve as a role model when it comes to human rights protection? To answer this question the course will cover the foundations of EU and Human Rights Law. We will scrutinize various sources of human rights and how they interact with the supranational legal order of the EU. In so doing topical legal developments such as the entry into force of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the forthcoming EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights will be discussed and evaluated."
LAW5624,Introduction to Islamic law,Faculty of Law,"[[['Malaysia'], ['Term 3 2017 (Day)']]]",6,0.125,LAW7470 or an equivalent introductory unit at another university.,,3,"In its first part, the unit will consider the nature, characteristics and objectives of Islamic Law and contrast them with other legal systems.

It will also cover significant developments in the permissible limitations on freedom of expression in view of other rights and interests such as property, equality, non-discrimination, public order, national security, privacy and reputation."
LAW5626,International and comparative insolvency law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," This course will cover the basics of bankruptcy/insolvency law and the general rights of creditors and debtors in various Western nations, i.e. from an international perspective.  The course will focus on the core aspects of commercial bankruptcy/insolvency statutes in these countries.It begins with a review of the key insolvency concepts and provisions set forth by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (""UNCITRAL"") with primary emphasis on Part Two of the UNCITRAL Guide On Insolvency Law,  entitled ""core provisions for an effective and efficient insolvency law"", including and highlighting its suggested provisions for reorganizations.  It will then address the insolvency statutes of the US and selected European regimes.  Finally, the course will compare the various statutory provisions in these nations together with their adoption, or not, of the UNCITRAL recommended terms and the effect thereof."
LAW5627,Judgment and decision-making,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"""Judgment and Decision-Making"" explores the principles of human perception, judgment and decision-making that underpin the legal system. Students will learn about the heuristics and shortcuts that people use to arrive at judgments and decisions, and the possible biasing effects on lawyers, juries, eye-witnesses, and judges. The course challenges students to discover best approaches to advocacy, when voluminous information must be presented to triers of fact. It highlights creative opportunities for evidence, in any matter of law that depends on what members of the relevant population think, believe, or intend to do. Classes are designed to foster high quality discussion and analysis providing an environment conducive to peer interaction and feedback with an emphasis on formative activities."
LAW5628,International and comparative trademark law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW7470/LAW5000 Australian legal reasoning and methods or LAW7436/LAW5081 Australian Legal Process and Research or LAW7212/LAW5080 Australian legal system,,3,"This unit will provide an overview of the obligations under international law to provide protection to trade marks and a comparison of selected, key aspects of trade mark protection in Australia, the United States and the EU. Consequently, in relation to international law, it will examine the trade mark aspects of the TRIPS agreement (including consideration of geographical indications) and the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of ICANN relating to domain names. To a lesser extent, the unit will deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol relating to multiple filings of trade mark applications. Selected, key aspects of comparison will include issues such as jurisdiction specific approaches to ownership, the requirements for registrability of trade marks such as shape trade marks and the different approaches to infringement, including dilution of trade marks and parallel importing. Other topics may include the registration and control of domain names. It is likely that, in light of Australian legislation and WTO challenges, the unit will also critically examine the arguments of the tobacco industry that international trade mark obligations prevent the implementation of plain packaging of cigarettes."
LAW5629,Comparative issues in patent law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,, LAW5340 Intellectual propertyLAW5321 Protecting commercial innovation: Patents and trade secrets,3,"This unit will examine from an international and comparative perspective the most fundamental question in patent law: what subject matter should patent law protect with a twenty year monopoly? It will consider the obligations that relevant international treaties and conventions impose on member states in the design of their patent laws. Within the context of this international structure, it will immerse students in understanding and critically analyzing the approaches taken to patentable subject matter by Canada, the US, the UK and Australia. In particular, it will focus on the challenges posed to patent law by new and emerging technologies in such areas as business methods and systems, software, higher life forms, methods of medical and surgical treatment and genetic materials. No technical background is required, expected, nor is any previous work in patent law needed."
LAW5630,European and international monetary law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This unit is divided into three main sections: interdisciplinary introduction to money and currencies; international monetary law; and European monetary law. The first section will explain the interdisciplinary fundamentals of money and currencies, including the historical background, economic theories and the role of law. The second section will introduce international monetary law, focusing on the work and functions of the IMF, which has played an increasingly major role in addressing global financial and sovereign debt crises. The third section will cover the monetary integration process in Europe, and a thorough examination of the European Monetary Union (EMU). The unit will conclude with a critical assessment of the much-debated recent developments within the EMU set in motion by the European sovereign debt crisis, including the implications for countries such as Greece and Germany."
LAW5631,"Lawyers, literature and cinema",Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,LAW7470/LAW5000 or LAW7212/LAW5080,,3," The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community.Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law."
LAW5632,International information and media law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3," Information and media content are potentially ubiquitous, whereas regulation, culture and context are generally not. This makes conflicts between different regulatory schemes inevitable. The conventional legal solutions of resolving jurisdictional conflicts, which have been designed for an offline world, are not sufficient to deal with the problems of the information age. The unit will survey the legal and regulatory approaches currently operating to resolve conflicts in the global exchange of information and media content. The different legal domestic approaches, and their interrelationship with emerging regional governance structures, will be critically examined.In the first part, the existing concepts of conflicts of law will be analysed and specific approaches (cyber law, setting of international standards, global media governance etc.) will be discussed, including the international institutions (WRC, ITU, ICANN) and dispute resolution fori (WTO, WIPO).The second part of the unit will explore the human rights context. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and of the media generally, can clash with other human rights such as privacy, data protection, and personality rights. Even though human rights are universal, the way conflicting human rights are balanced will reflect the cultural context and diversity of legal systems.The third part will shift the focus to the media and information industry. Media content and information must also be seen from a business perspective and, when disseminated across borders, have regard to international business law. Intellectual property and international trade agreements are important levers for the protection of local culture and other domestic interests.The fourth and final part will deal with information-related crimes, such as copyright violations, propaganda, pornography and child abuse, as well as with information warfare."
LAW5633,Contemporary workplace relations law,Faculty of Law,[],6,0.125,,,3,"This unit will examine the following major areas: the development of systems for regulating dispute settlement and determining conditions of employment, including  the Australian federal system for regulating workplace relations, industrial disputes and minimum conditions of employment, the systems in North America, United Kingdom and Europe; the impact of globalization and international labour standards through international labour organization conventions and its regulation; the scope and coverage of domestic legislation, including  the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and its constitutional basis and the degree of legislative intervention in comparator countries of Australia, United States, Canada, and Europe; sources of minimum conditions , minimum wages and the safety nets; the purpose, scope and content of collective and enterprise agreements; good faith bargaining and the use of industrial action as a bargaining tool; the protection of workplace rights, such as the right to join a union in the comparator countries; and approaches to the enforcement of minimum conditions, modern awards and enterprise agreements, in Australia through the Fair Work Ombudsman and the court system and in the comparator countries."
