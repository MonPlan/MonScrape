Wunderkammers) and present-day instances of curating where the term has become virtually synonymous with any act of selection (music, photographs, food). The overall aim of the unit is provide students with a working vocabulary so that they can ask critical questions of the contemporary practice of curation.Lectures will largely provide a chronological history of curation, starting with early museums and collections, but with an emphasis on the rise of curating and the figure of the curator from the mid-1970s on. A number of key instances of curation (particular exhibitions and international Biennales and Triennials) will be selected for particular analysis. In this way, students will be given both an overall history of art curation and a way of thinking the term's almost infinite expansion in the present. The overall aim of the unit is to provide students with an appropriate working method for any curation they might undertake in the future and a way of thinking about issues of curation if they choose to work in a museum or write about art.

Following the practice of contemporary curation, these acts of curation need not necessarily involve works of art. Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final ""public"" (whether in reality or using such technologies as the internet) exhibition of such curation and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. Students will work with their lecturer throughout the semester to develop this exhibition/series of exhibitions. Classes will consist of 3-hour long seminars in which the lecturer works with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold ""crit"" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped. As in art-making classes, an end-of-class overall exhibition will be planned, and part of the unit will require students (along with the lecturer) to plan how such an overall exhibition of exhibitions might be conceived, planned and brought to practical realisation.

Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms.

The unit culminates in a final project, through which students manage a 'mock' Australian-Indonesian crisis, thusly demonstrating the critical value of cultural literacy in the Asian Century.This unit is broken into three phases. The first phase introduces the 'Indonesian perspective', with a focus on the archipelago's history, religions and cultures. The second phases familiarizes students with how cultural distance impacts Indonesia's relationship and communication with other regional and global powers. The third and final phase entails a focus on crisis management in the Asian Century. Students firstly encounter case studies of flashpoints and crises in the Australian-Indonesian relationship. Students are then called upon to manage a mock crisis, with the goal of providing a positive outcome through the practical application of cultural literacy.The unit is Indonesian-focused but will be relevant to students more generally concerned with Australia's role in the Asian Century, and how this role influences diplomacy, business and journalism among other fields.",,,,,,,,

In particular, our contemporary world is saturated with visual information, and endless debates about the status of literature in the face of visual media. However, such debates are not without precedence. The Renaissance already witnessed emphatic debates on the impact of visual cultures on discourse, literature, and knowledge as a whole. Furthermore, the question of Literature and the Image is not the exclusive battleground of European languages. Indeed, Asian cultures have a similarly complex history of interaction between literature and visual forms, albeit shaped by the nature of differing writing systems. This electives incorporates this crucial global comparative element to explore the following three main areas of study. First, it addresses the History and Theory of literature and visual culture. Second, it explores the concrete forms of visual culture, such as photography and literature, film and literature, combined forms emerging from Surrealism, Avant-Garde and Pop literature, as well as comics and graphic novels. Finally, it provides a comparative perspective by addressing Asian forms of language and visuality, literature and visuality, and comics and manga.",,,,,,,,

Such questions will be posed in terms of the political and ideological context of the time: broadly, the gradual but alarming transformation of a static feudal hierarchy into the fluid social order of capitalism, and the challenges posed by (some) women to the limiting assumptions of institutionalized patriarchy.The unit raises fundamental questions such as: What are we looking for in the texts we read? Can we, or should we, use literature to understand what authors and their contemporary readers thought about an issue: using literary texts as sociological and historical artefacts? Or should we, or do we, read an ever-widening circle of texts as an exercise in pleasure-seeking, or as a way of looking for a universal truth about the human condition, or the nature of truth or beauty?Students will be encouraged to consider these question via a series of self-guided explorations of literature from the past, relating texts they have chosen to a corpus of contemporary literature.",,,,,,,,

Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions.

As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space.

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012.  Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently.  In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism.

In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history. The combination of the 'liberal' state and capitalism, they claimed, embodies the ultimate form of human organisation. Politics, they argued, is therefore a thing of the past. Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world.

"VPR3011","Professional practice advanced","Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",6,0.125,"VPR2012 and 1 department approved elective","VPR3001",1,"This is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence and is first of the two 3rd year units. The unit provides students with an advanced perspective on the various modes of publication available to cultural practitioners engaged in Visual Art. This unit gives students an opportunity to incorporate theoretical frameworks that reflect and expand upon a breadth of fields that include education, business, information technology or the liberal arts into their production of visual culture. This unit asks students to develop self-directed strategies that extend upon traditional gallery based exhibition modes. These modes might include: artists' books, editioned objects; site-based research and exhibiting; digital broadcast; collaborative, social and/or performative processes; curatorial contexts; and creative arts writing. The workshop program encourages an experimental and critical approach to conceptual and material outcomes whilst providing opportunities to cultivate curatorial, critical writing and administrative skills. Students are required to initiate individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer-review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.",,,,,,,,,
"VPR3012","Visual practices 3","Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",12,0.25,"VPR3011 and 2 department approved electives","VPR3002",1,"This unit is the last and culminating unit in the Visual Practices sequence and is second of the two 3rd year units. In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",,,,,,,,,

It is designed to provide students with first hand experience of working within the culture industry while introducing them to the types of research customarily undertaken in such institutions. After several preliminary seminars, students will be assigned to a museum/ gallery in which they will work for two days per week, over a period of nine weeks, under the direction of the relevant director. They will undertake a research project of specific relevance to the cultural institution.",,,,,,,,,
"VSA4076","Australian postmodernism","Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture",12,0.25,,,1,"The recurring issues of regionalism and internationalism will be addressed, as will interpretations of Australia as the site of international congruence and influence. The unit will move from discussion of the American influence of The Field exhibition of 1968 to the 'pluralism' of the 1970s: minimal art, performance art and feminism. The focus on the 1980s and 1990s will address some of the following: neo-expressionism, appropriation, nomadology, aboriginality, theoretical issues and the current status of Australian art, including recent developments in abstraction, installation, gay art and 'angry women.'",,,,,,,,,
