Although numeracy is sometimes thought of as a subset of mathematics, it can also be seen as encompassing a different set of aims and objectives. For example, the power of 'pure' mathematics can be thought of as resting in the pleasure that mathematicians gain from 'playing' with mathematics for its own sake, and the resultant ever more abstract nature of the subject. In contrast, being numerate means working in the opposite direction: looking for the mathematics potentially 'hidden' in the world and drawing on quantitative skills to question particular issues. Numeracy is linked to being able to make critically informed judgements, judgements for which mathematical knowledge in itself may not equip one. By addressing such issues the unit develops both students' understanding of numeracy and mathematics and what this means for them as teachers and future leaders of numeracy in schools."

In particular, it focuses on the interplay between pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge theoretically conceptualised as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). While there have been many examples of PCK as the basis for expert educator knowledge, exploring this concept in STEM education disrupts many assumptions in relation to the knowledge base of expert educators. The unit focuses on the ways in which STEM challenges the notion of knowledge as an individual attribute (belonging to a person), instead considering the knowledge as being distributed amongst people and significantly how this knowledge base is dynamic and therefore changes over time. Students are challenged to consider the ways in which a dynamic, distributed conceptualisation of knowledge can start to shift and shape our views about STEM pedagogy. Within the unit, there is a strong focus on theoretical explorations of STEM knowledge, STEM pedagogies and the development of an identity as a STEM leader together with pragmatic considerations of the ways in which these ideas shape STEM as a true interdisciplinary field which requires collaboration between educators as much as it does from students.

Calls for evidence-based policy and practice have become increasingly widespread across many areas of public policy. Within education, there is increasing emphasis on the need for research evidence to be used in the improvement of educational practice and the development of educational policy. But what is research evidence and where can it be accessed? How can different kinds of research evidence be evaluated critically and applied to practice and policy? What skills and processes are involved in using research evidence to solve problems, make decisions and lead change? And what is behind the growth of evidence-based agendas within and beyond education? Through exploration of each of the above questions, students develop their skills in identifying, distinguishing and appraising different kinds of research evidence. Drawing on different models and approaches to research use, they gain experience analysing, using and communicating research evidence in relation to a specific concern of relevance to their professional or educational contexts. This unit enables students to develop their understandings of evidence-based policy and practice, to gain first-hand experience of identifying, evaluating, using and communicating research evidence, and to become more confident and skilled users of research."

Self-study involves systematic examination of one's own professional practice in order to gain greater understanding, and to make changes that enhance practice. The unit introduces self-study as a research approach for professional/practitioner inquiry. Its features are distinguished, including its qualitative nature and its philosophical standpoints on what counts as 'knowledge' for research purposes. Students identify the forms of data collection and analysis that may be suitable for inquiring into one's own practice. These are applied as students plan to conduct their own small-scale self-study project through which they deepen their learning around their personal and professional identity, their ethical responsibilities and collaborative engagement.
