It explores ways of formulating research question(s) and hypotheses, and identifies assumptions and theories that are relevant in the development of a conceptual framework for research. The topics discussed will cover principles of the scientific method, key epistemological perspectives in the social sciences (e.g. positivism, interpretivism, social constructivism, hermeneutics, functionalism, critical theory) and argument analysis (e.g. avoiding fallacies in scientific reasoning, evaluating and constructing sound arguments). These discussions will clarify the theoretical and practical underpinnings of research design, inform subsequent analyses of how to select different research methods (qualitative, quantitative, mixed), and illustrate key issues associated with main argument development in a HDR thesis. Finally, the unit will examine ways of presenting a compelling theoretical and practical case for the epistemological significance of a HDR project, and examine how this approach could increase the likelihood of successful publication of research results."

The key question it will seek to answer is: ""how should organisations strategically create and exchange market offerings effectively to enable value for themselves, their customers and clients, business partners, and society at large?"" The perspective held would be the management of markets, with a view to achieving and sustaining market leading positions. While anchored to the viewpoint of a focal organisation, analysis would include institutions that facilitate the consummation of market exchange in an economy, and the myriad consequences of market management activity on society. The predominant pedagogy is case-based, and thus classroom discussion will emphasise strategic decision-making situations. The decision orientation will be supplemented with contemporary critical-ethical thought on marketing as a discipline of business and society."
